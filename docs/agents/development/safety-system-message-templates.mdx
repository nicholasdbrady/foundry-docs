# Safety system message templates

<Note>
This article refers to the [Microsoft Foundry (new)](../what-is-foundry.md#microsoft-foundry-portals) portal.
</Note>{/* > 🔄 [Switch to the Microsoft Foundry (classic) documentation]() if you're using the classic portal. */}

This article contains recommended safety system messages for your generative AI systems to help reduce the propensity of harm in various concern areas. Before you begin evaluating and integrating your safety system messages, visit the [Safety system message conceptual guide](/agents/development/system-message) to get started.

<Note>
Using a safety system message is one of many techniques you can use to mitigate risks in AI systems. It’s different from the [Azure AI Content Safety](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/content-safety/overview) service.
</Note>
## How to use these templates

Use these templates as a starting point. They’re intentionally generic so you can adapt them for your scenario.

- **Start small and iterate.** Add one component at a time, then test.
- **Replace bracketed placeholders.** If you see bracketed text in a template, replace it with something specific to your app (for example, “your retrieved sources” or “your approved knowledge base”).
- **Avoid conflicting instructions.** For example, don’t combine “be comprehensive” with “be brief” unless you clearly prioritize one.
- **Tell the model what to do when it can’t comply.** Clear refusal and fallback behavior helps reduce unsafe completions.

### Where to put the text

- **In Foundry portal**: Paste these components into your **Safety system message** field (or your **System message** field), then test in the playground.
- **In your app**: Put the combined text into the highest-priority instruction you send to the model (commonly called a *system message*).

For design guidance, see [System message design](/agents/development/advanced-prompt-engineering) and [Safety system messages](/agents/development/system-message).

## Recommended system messages

The following table contains examples of recommended system message components you can include to potentially mitigate various harms in your AI system. 

| Category | Component | When this concern area may apply |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Harmful content: hate and fairness, sexual, violence, self-harm | `- You must not generate content that may be harmful to someone physically or emotionally even if a user requests or creates a condition to rationalize that harmful content.` <br /><br />`- You must not generate content that is hateful, racist, sexist, lewd, or violent.` | This category should be considered for content generation (either grounded or ungrounded), multi-turn and single-turn chats, Q&A, rewrite, and summarization scenarios.   |
| Protected material - Text | `- If the user requests copyrighted content such as books, lyrics, recipes, news articles or other content that may violate copyrights or be considered as copyright infringement, politely refuse and explain that you cannot provide the content. Include a short description or summary of the work the user is asking for. You **must not** violate any copyrights under any circumstances. ` | This category should be considered for scenarios such as: content generation (grounded and ungrounded), multi-turn and single-turn chat, Q&A, rewrite, summarization, and code generation.  |
| Ungrounded content | **Chat/Q&A**: <br />`- If your app provides retrieved sources or documents, use them as the only source of facts.`<br />`- If the sources don’t contain enough information, say you can’t find it in the provided sources.`<br />`- Don’t add facts that aren’t in the sources.`<br /><br />**Summarization**: <br />`- Keep the summary faithful to the document. Don’t add new facts or assumptions.`<br />`- Keep the document’s tone and meaning.`<br />`- Don’t change dates, numbers, or names.` | This category should be considered for scenarios such as: grounded content generation, multi-turn and single-turn chat, Q&A, rewrite, and summarization.  |

## Add safety system messages in Microsoft Foundry portal 

The following steps show how to use safety system messages in [Foundry portal](https://ai.azure.com/?cid=learnDocs).

</Frame>

<Note>
If you’re using a safety system message that isn’t built in by default, copy the component you need and paste it into either the safety system message section or the system message section. Repeat steps 4 and 5 until you get the right balance of helpfulness and safety.
</Note>## Test your safety system message

After adding a safety system message, test it with both benign and adversarial prompts:

1. **Benign test**: Send a normal user request to confirm the model responds helpfully.
1. **Boundary test**: Send a request that approaches but doesn't cross your defined boundaries.
1. **Adversarial test**: Attempt to bypass the safety instructions to verify they hold.

If the model refuses too often or allows harmful content, adjust your safety system message and retest. See [Safety system messages](/agents/development/system-message) for iteration strategies.

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Likely cause | What to try |
| --- | --- | --- |
| The model refuses too often. | The message is too broad or too strict. | Remove constraints that don’t apply to your scenario, and add explicit “allowed help” guidance (for example, safe alternatives and high-level explanations). |
| Unsafe content still appears. | The message is too narrow, or user prompts override behavior. | Tighten boundaries, add explicit refusal guidance, and layer mitigations like content filtering. See [Content filtering overview](content-filter.md). |
| Responses are inconsistent across runs. | Conflicting instructions or unclear priorities. | Remove conflicts, prioritize rules, and keep the message shorter. See [Common pitfalls](/agents/development/advanced-prompt-engineering#common-pitfalls). |
| The model invents facts when summarizing or answering from sources. | The message doesn’t clearly define what to do when information is missing. | Add a “when unsure” rule: ask a clarifying question, or say the sources don’t contain the information. |

## Disability-related content guidance

Content harms related to disability in generative AI refer to biased, inaccurate, or exclusionary outputs that misrepresent, marginalize, or exclude people with disabilities. Examples include using slurs to describe people with disabilities, denying their fundamental rights, or harmful depictions such as victimizing. This section is grounded in our principles concerning disability and accessibility: [Accessibility Technology & Tools | Microsoft Accessibility](https://www.microsoft.com/accessibility).

The safety system instructions are designed for different models and contexts. Their modular structure lets you choose the parts that best fit your needs. For instance, the term “impairment” may be suitable in some regions but not in others. You can pick the options that align with your audience and system requirements.
<Note>
The model-specific guidance in this section reflects best practices at time of publication. Verify current recommendations with each vendor's documentation.

## Limitations

Safety system messages aren’t a complete safety solution:

- They can be bypassed or degraded by adversarial prompting.
- They can reduce usefulness if they’re too strict.
- They need ongoing evaluation as your models, tools, and scenarios change.

To reduce risk, combine system messages with other mitigations such as content filtering. See [Content filtering overview](content-filter.md) and the [Azure AI Content Safety quickstart](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/content-safety/quickstart-text) for layered protection.

## Evaluation

We recommend you adjust your safety system message approach based on an iterative process of identification and evaluation. Learn more in the [Safety system message conceptual guide](/agents/development/system-message).

## Next steps
