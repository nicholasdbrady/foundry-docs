# Connect Azure Speech in Foundry Tools to an agent

Azure Speech in Foundry Tools lets your agent convert speech to text and generate speech audio from text. You connect the tool by adding a remote Model Context Protocol (MCP) server to your agent in Foundry Agent Service.

<Info>
The Speech MCP tool doesn't support [Network-secured Microsoft Foundry](/setup/virtual-networks). For more information, see [Connect to Model Context Protocol servers](/agents/tools/model-context-protocol).
</Info>

## Prerequisites

- An Azure subscription. [Create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/purchase-options/azure-account?cid=msft_learn).
- A [Microsoft Foundry resource](/setup/multi-service-resource) created in a [supported region](../../../../../ai-services/speech-service/regions.md). Your Foundry resource includes speech capabilities and is used by the Speech MCP server. The Speech MCP Server is available in all regions where Foundry Agent Service supports [MCP tools](/agents/tools/tool-best-practice#tool-support-by-region-and-model).

## Usage support

This article shows how to connect the tool in Foundry portal.

If you want to work with code, see [Connect to Model Context Protocol servers](/agents/tools/model-context-protocol) for SDK examples in Python, C#, and JavaScript.

## Security and privacy

Treat your Speech resource key and storage SAS URLs as secrets:

- Don’t paste keys or SAS URLs into agent prompts, chat transcripts, screenshots, or source control.
- Use the shortest practical SAS expiry time.
- Scope SAS URLs to the minimum required resource (for example, a single container).
- Rotate keys periodically as a security best practice, or immediately if you suspect they're exposed.

## Set up storage

You need an Azure Storage account to store input audio files for speech-to-text processing and receive output audio files from text-to-speech processing. [Create an Azure Storage account](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-account-create).

Ensure your user account has the **Storage Blob Data Contributor** role assigned for the storage account, so you can create SAS URLs later on.

Create one or more blob containers to store the input and output audio files.

## Create an agent

1. Go to [Microsoft Foundry](https://ai.azure.com/?cid=learnDocs).
1. In the upper-right menu, select **Build**.
1. In the left pane, select **Agents**, and then select **Create agent**.
1. Enter a name and description, and then select **Create**.

## Connect the Azure Speech tool to your agent

1. In your agent, open the agent playground.
1. Under **Tools**, select **Add** -> **Add a new tool**.
1. In **Select a tool**, select the **Catalog** tab.
1. Search for **Azure Speech MCP Server**, select it, and then select **Create**.
1. On the setup page, fill in the following fields:  

    - **Parameters** -> `foundry-resource-name`: Enter the name of the Foundry resource you created in the prerequisites.
    - **Authorization** -> `Bearer` (API Key): Enter a key from your Foundry resource. You can use either `KEY1` or `KEY2` from your resource’s **Keys and Endpoint** page in the Azure portal.
    - **Authorization** -> `X-Blob-Container-Url`: Generate a SAS URL for your storage container with read and write permissions, and then enter it here. The service stores audio output files in this container.
    
1. Select **Connect** to add the remote Speech MCP server as a tool for your agent.

   After connecting, the Speech tool appears in your agent's **Tools** list with a connected status.

## Test the Azure Speech tool

In the agent playground chat, enter `What can you do?`.

<Tip>
Select a capable base model for best results.
</Tip>

The agent lists its available capabilities, including the newly added Speech Capabilities such as speech-to-text and text-to-speech. This confirms that the remote Speech MCP server is successfully connected.

### Test speech-to-text

The Speech tool can convert an audio file to text. The audio file can be stored in Azure Blob Storage and accessed with a SAS URL, or it can be any publicly accessible URL to an audio file.

<Note>
Supported audio formats include WAV, MP3, OGG, FLAC, and other common formats. For best results with speech recognition, use WAV files with 16 kHz sample rate and 16-bit depth.
</Note>

1. Upload your audio file to your Azure blob storage container.  
1. Generate a SAS URL for the file:
   1. Select your uploaded audio file.
   1. In **Properties**, select **Generate SAS**.
   1. Set the shortest practical expiry time, and then select **Generate SAS token and URL**.
1. Copy the SAS URL. Then use it in one of the following example prompts in the agent chat window: 
    - `Recognize this English audio file located in <blob SAS URL>` 
    - `Recognize the audio file located in <blob SAS URL> with these phrase hints: "Azure, OpenAI, Cognitive Services, Lucy" to improve accuracy.` 
    - `Convert this audio file located in <blob SAS URL> into text and summarize it for me.` 
    - `Recognize this French audio file located in <blob SAS URL> with detailed output format.` 
    - `Recognize this Hindi audio file located in <blob SAS URL> and remove profanity.` 
1. View the output text in the chat window.

### Test text-to-speech

Start a new chat in the agent playground, and use one of the following example prompts. Replace the placeholder with your own text:
- `Convert text to speech: <your text to speak>` 
- `Synthesize speech from "<your text to speak>"`
- `Generate speech audio from text "<your text to speak>"` 
- `Convert text to speech with Chinese language: <your text to speak>` 
- `Synthesize speech with voice en-US-JennyNeural from text <your text to speak>` 

The output audio is saved as a WAV file in your blob container. An audio link is displayed in the chat window. Select it to listen to the output.

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Likely cause | Resolution |
| --- | --- | --- |
| You can’t find **Azure Speech MCP Server** in the tool catalog. | The tool isn’t available for your tenant, region, or scenario. | Confirm your Foundry resource is created in a supported region and try again. |
| **Connect** fails with authorization errors. | The API key is incorrect or expired. | Recopy `KEY1` or `KEY2` from your resource’s **Keys and Endpoint** page. Rotate keys if needed. |
| Speech output audio link doesn’t work. | The container SAS URL is invalid, expired, or missing permissions. | Regenerate the container SAS URL with read and write permissions and a valid expiry time. |
| Speech-to-text can’t access the audio file. | The file SAS URL is invalid or expired. | Regenerate the file SAS URL and retry the prompt. |
