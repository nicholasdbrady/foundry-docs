<sup>1, 2</sup> Foundry provides a Model playground and an Agent playground. When you use the playground to experiment with a model, Foundry presents you with the relevant playground for that model. For example, when you use an image generation model like gpt-image-1, you're presented with the images playground. For a video model like Sora-2, Foundry opens up a video playground.

## Why use playgrounds before production

Modern development involves working across multiple systems—APIs, services, SDKs, and data models—often before you're ready to fully commit to a framework, write tests, or spin up infrastructure. As the complexity of software ecosystems increases, the need for safe, lightweight environments to validate ideas becomes critical. The playgrounds are built to meet this need.

The Foundry playgrounds provide ready-to-use environments with all the necessary tools and features preinstalled, so you don't need to set up projects, manage dependencies, or solve compatibility issues. The playgrounds can *accelerate developer velocity* by validating API behavior, going quicker to code, reducing cost of experimentation and time to ship, accelerating integration, optimizing prompts, and more.

Playgrounds also *provide clarity quickly* when you have questions, by providing answers in seconds—rather than hours—and allowing you to test and validate ideas before you commit to building at scale. For example, the playgrounds are ideal for quickly answering questions like:

- What's the minimal prompt I need to get the output I want?
- Will this logic work before I write a full integration?
- How does latency or token usage change with different configurations?
- What model provides the best price-to-performance ratio before I evolve it into an agent?

## Open in VS Code capability

The **Model playground** and **Agents playground** let you work in VS Code by using the **Open in VS Code for the Web** button. You can find this button from the **Code** tab in the chat pane of the model playground.

Available on the multilingual sample code samples, **Open in VS Code for the Web** automatically imports your code sample, API endpoint, and key to a VS Code workspace in an `/azure` environment. This functionality makes it easy to work in the VS Code IDE from the Foundry portal.

To use the **Open in VS Code for the Web** functionality from the model playground:

1. Deploy a model and open its playground.
1. Select the **Code** tab in the chat pane.
1. Select your preferred programming language from the language tabs.
1. Select **Open in VS Code for the Web** to open VS Code in a new browser tab.
1. You're redirected to a VS Code for the Web environment where your code sample, API endpoint, and key are already imported from the Foundry playground.
1. Browse the `INSTRUCTIONS.md` file for guidance on running your model.
1. View your code sample and relevant dependencies in the generated files.

## Agents playground

The agents playground lets you explore, prototype, and test agents without running any code. From this page, you can quickly iterate and experiment with new ideas. 

<Note>
When you use the Agents playground to experiment with a model, Foundry presents you with the relevant playground for that model. For example, when you use an image generation model like gpt-image-1, you're presented with the images playground. For a video model like Sora-2, Foundry opens up a video playground.
</Note>

In the agents playground, you can:

- Configure agent instructions and persona.
- Attach tools such as code interpreter, file search, and web search.
- Add knowledge sources to ground agent responses.
- Test multi-turn conversations with the agent.
- View tracing and evaluation data for agent responses through AgentOps.
- Save and iterate on agent configurations before deploying.

To get started with the agents playground, see [Understanding the agent development lifecycle](/agents/development/development-lifecycle).

## Model playground

When you deploy a model in the [Microsoft Foundry](https://ai.azure.com/?cid=learnDocs) portal, you immediately land on its playground. The model playground is an interactive experience designed for developers to test and experiment with the latest models from providers like Azure OpenAI, DeepSeek, xAI, and Meta. The playground gives you full control over model behavior, safety, and deployment so that you can tune system prompts, compare model outputs in real time, or integrate tools like web search and code execution.

<Note>
When you use the Model playground to experiment with a model, Foundry presents you with the relevant playground for that model. For example, when you use an image generation model like gpt-image-1, you're presented with the images playground. For a video model like Sora-2, Foundry opens up a video playground.
</Note>

The playground is designed for fast iteration and production readiness. It supports everything from prototyping to performance benchmarking. The playground prepares you to use your model in a production workflow, easily upgrade your model as an agent, and continue to prototype in the agent playground with additional tools, knowledge, and memory before deploying as an agentic web application. 

### Benefits of using the model playground

- **Full-stack experimentation and control**: Configure parameters (such as temperature, top_p, max_tokens), inject system prompts, and enable advanced tools like web search, file search, and code interpreter, all within a single environment. This setup allows you to precisely tune model behavior and rapidly iterate on prompt engineering, grounding, and RAG workflows, upgrading your model into an agent.

- **Built-in safety and governance**: Assign or create guardrails to protect against jailbreaks, indirect prompt injections, and unsafe outputs. This integrated safety layer ensures you can validate compliance and responsible AI behaviors in a controlled, testable sandbox, without needing to wire external moderation logic.

- **Comparative and deployable by design**: Compare up to three models in parallel with synced input/output to benchmark response quality. Export multilingual code samples, grab endpoints and keys, and open in VS Code for immediate integration, bridging experimentation to production in one streamlined developer workflow.

### Compare models

Compare mode enables developers to run controlled, parallel evaluations across up to three models simultaneously, using a synchronized input stream. Each model receives the exact same prompt context, system message, and parameter configuration, ensuring consistent test conditions for output benchmarking. Responses stream in real time, allowing developers to measure and visualize differences in latency, token throughput, and response fidelity side-by-side.

To use compare mode from the playground of a deployed model:

1. Select **Compare models** in the upper-right corner.
1. Select up to two more models from existing or new deployments. Chat windows for the selected models open up side-by-side in the playground with synced prompt bars and setup. You can switch off sync from the **Setup** pane for each model, if needed.
1. Enter your prompt in any of the prompt bars and see the prompt simultaneously appear in the others.
1. Submit the prompt to see the output from each model simultaneously and compare the quality of the responses.
1. Switch to the **Code** tab in the chat pane of each model to see multilingual code samples.
1. For your preferred model, select either **Open in VS Code for the Web** from the code tab to continue development work or **Save as agent** to continue prototyping in the agent playground.

### Generate and interpret code

With code interpreter, you can extend model capabilities beyond text generation by enabling in-line code execution within the playground. When activated, supported models can write, run, and debug code directly in a secure, sandboxed environment. This environment is ideal for performing calculations, data transformations, plotting visualizations, or validating logic.

To use code interpreter from the playground of a deployed model:

1. Expand the **Tools** section in the deployed model's playground. 

<Tip>
The **Tools** section isn't visible in the playground if you use compare mode to run parallel evaluations on models. You first have to close the other models that you're using for comparison before you can see the detailed playground that includes tools and other options for your deployed model.
</Tip>

1. Select **Add** > **Code interpreter**, and attach your code files for the code interpreter.
1. Use the playground to ask questions, interpret, or streamline your code. For example, "How should I make the attached code files more efficient?"

### What to validate when experimenting in the model playground

When you use the model playground to plan your production workload, explore and validate the following attributes:

- **Prompt Engineering**
    - What system prompt structure produces the best output quality for your use case?
    - How do few-shot examples affect response consistency and accuracy?

- **Parameter Sensitivity**
    - How does changing temperature, top_p, and max_tokens affect response quality?
    - What's the optimal configuration for your latency and cost requirements?

- **Tool Integration**
    - Does web search grounding improve factual accuracy for your domain?
    - How does code interpreter handle your specific data transformation needs?

- **Safety Configuration**
    - Do your guardrails block adversarial prompts while allowing legitimate use cases?
    - What content safety thresholds work best for your production requirements?

- **Model Comparison**
    - Which model provides the best price-to-performance ratio for your use case?
    - What are the latency and token usage differences across comparable models?

- **Code Export Readiness**
    - Do the generated code samples run correctly in your local environment?
    - Are the API patterns compatible with your existing codebase?

## Video playground

The video playground (preview) is your rapid iteration environment for exploring, refining, and validating generative video workflows. It's designed for developers who need to go from idea to prototype with precision, control, and speed. The playground gives you a low-friction interface to test prompt structures, assess motion fidelity, evaluate model consistency across frames, and compare outputs across models—without writing boilerplate or wasting compute cycles.

<Note>
The video playground is one of the modalities of the Model playground and Agent playground in Foundry. When you use the playground to experiment with a video model like Sora-2, Foundry opens up the video playground.
</Note>

All model endpoints are integrated with **Azure AI Content Safety**. As a result, the video playground filters out harmful and unsafe images before they appear. If content moderation policies flag your text prompt or video generation, you get a warning notification.

You can use the video playground with the **Azure OpenAI Sora-2** model.

Follow these steps to use the video playground:
