# Quickstart: Generate images with Azure OpenAI in Microsoft Foundry Models

<Note>
This article refers to the [Microsoft Foundry (new)](/overview/what-is-foundry#microsoft-foundry-portals) portal.
</Note>{/* > 🔄 [Switch to the Microsoft Foundry (classic) documentation]() if you're using the classic portal. */}

Azure OpenAI provides multiple image generation models. This quickstart covers both model families:

| Model | Availability | Key capabilities |
|-------|--------------|------------------|
| **DALL-E 3** | Generally available | High-quality image generation with `quality` and `style` parameters. Best for production workloads. |
| **GPT-image-1 series** | Limited access preview | Image generation plus editing and variations. Best for advanced image manipulation workflows. Requires [limited access registration](https://aka.ms/oai/access). |

<Tip>
Image generation typically takes 10-30 seconds depending on the model, size, and quality settings.
</Tip>
Use the tabs to select your preferred API approach and model.

Use this guide to get started calling the Azure OpenAI in Microsoft Foundry Models image generation REST APIs by using Python.

## Prerequisites

- An Azure subscription. [Create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/purchase-options/azure-account?cid=msft_learn).
- <a href="https://www.python.org/" target="_blank">Python 3.8 or later version</a>.
- The following Python libraries installed: `os`, `requests`, `json`.
- An Azure OpenAI resource created in a supported region. See [Region availability](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-foundry/openai/concepts/models#model-summary-table-and-region-availability).
- Then, you need to deploy a `gpt-image-1`-series or `dalle3` model with your Azure resource. For more information, see [Create a resource and deploy a model with Azure OpenAI](../how-to/create-resource.md).

## Setup 

### Retrieve key and endpoint

To successfully call the Azure OpenAI APIs, you need the following information about your Azure OpenAI resource:

| Variable | Name | Value |
|---|---|---|
| **Endpoint** | `api_base` | The endpoint value is located under **Keys and Endpoint** for your resource in the Azure portal. You can also find the endpoint via the **Deployments** page in Foundry portal. An example endpoint is: `https://docs-test-001.openai.azure.com/`. |
| **Key** | `api_key` | The key value is also located under **Keys and Endpoint** for your resource in the Azure portal. Azure generates two keys for your resource. You can use either value. |

Go to your resource in the Azure portal. On the navigation pane, select **Keys and Endpoint** under **Resource Management**. Copy the **Endpoint** value and an access key value. You can use either the **KEY 1** or **KEY 2** value. Always having two keys allows you to securely rotate and regenerate keys without causing a service disruption.

</Frame>

### Environment variables

Create and assign persistent environment variables for your key and endpoint.

<CodeGroup>
```cmd Command Line
    setx AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY "REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_KEY_VALUE_HERE" 
    setx AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT "REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_ENDPOINT_HERE" 
    ```

```powershell PowerShell
    [System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable('AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY', 'REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_KEY_VALUE_HERE', 'User')
    [System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable('AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT', 'REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_ENDPOINT_HERE', 'User')
    ```

```bash Bash
    export AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY="REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_KEY_VALUE_HERE"
    export AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT="REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_ENDPOINT_HERE"
    ```
</CodeGroup>

## Create a new Python application

Create a new Python file named _quickstart.py_. Open the new file in your preferred editor or IDE.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="GPT-image-1 series">

    1. Replace the contents of _quickstart.py_ with the following code. Change the value of `prompt` to your preferred text. Also set `deployment` to the deployment name you chose when you deployed the GPT-image-1 series model.

        ```python
        import os
        import requests
        import base64
        from PIL import Image
        from io import BytesIO

        # set environment variables
        endpoint = os.getenv("AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT")
        subscription_key = os.getenv("AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY")

        deployment = "gpt-image-1.5" # the name of your GPT-image-1 series deployment
        api_version = "2025-04-01-preview" # or later version

        def decode_and_save_image(b64_data, output_filename):
          image = Image.open(BytesIO(base64.b64decode(b64_data)))
          image.show()
          image.save(output_filename)

        def save_all_images_from_response(response_data, filename_prefix):
          for idx, item in enumerate(response_data['data']):
            b64_img = item['b64_json']
            filename = f"{filename_prefix}_{idx+1}.png"
            decode_and_save_image(b64_img, filename)
            print(f"Image saved to: '{filename}'")

        base_path = f'openai/deployments/{deployment}/images'
        params = f'?api-version={api_version}'

        generation_url = f"{endpoint}{base_path}/generations{params}"
        generation_body = {
          "prompt": "girl falling asleep",
          "n": 1,
          "size": "1024x1024",
          "quality": "medium",
          "output_format": "png"
        }
        generation_response = requests.post(
          generation_url,
          headers={
            'Api-Key': subscription_key,
            'Content-Type': 'application/json',
          },
          json=generation_body
        ).json()
        save_all_images_from_response(generation_response, "generated_image")

        # In addition to generating images, you can edit them.
        edit_url = f"{endpoint}{base_path}/edits{params}"
        edit_body = {
          "prompt": "girl falling asleep",
          "n": 1,
          "size": "1024x1024",
          "quality": "medium"
        }
        files = {
          "image": ("generated_image_1.png", open("generated_image_1.png", "rb"), "image/png"),
          # You can use a mask to specify which parts of the image you want to edit.
          # The mask must be the same size as the input image.
          # "mask": ("mask.png", open("mask.png", "rb"), "image/png"),
        }
        edit_response = requests.post(
          edit_url,
          headers={'Api-Key': subscription_key},
          data=edit_body,
          files=files
        ).json()
        save_all_images_from_response(edit_response, "edited_image")
        ```

        The script makes a synchronous image generation API call.

<Info>

</Info>    > Remember to remove the key from your code when you're done, and never post your key publicly. For production, use a secure way of storing and accessing your credentials. For more information, see [Azure Key Vault](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/key-vault/general/overview).

    1. Run the application with the `python` command:

        ```console
        python quickstart.py
        ```

        Wait a few moments to get the response.

    \{/*
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Black Forest Labs">
    tbd
    */\}

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="DALL-E">

    1. Replace the contents of _quickstart.py_ with the following code. Change the value of `prompt` to your preferred text.

        You also need to replace `<dalle3>` in the URL with the deployment name you chose when you deployed the DALL-E 3 model. Entering the model name will result in an error unless you chose a deployment name that is identical to the underlying model name. If you encounter an error, double check to make sure that you don't have a doubling of the `/` at the separation between your endpoint and `/openai/deployments`.

        ```python
        import requests
        import time
        import os
        api_base = os.environ['AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT']  # Enter your endpoint here
        api_key = os.environ['AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY']         # Enter your API key here

        api_version = '2024-02-01'
        url = f"{api_base}/openai/deployments/<dalle3>/images/generations?api-version={api_version}"
        headers= { "api-key": api_key, "Content-Type": "application/json" }
        body = {
            # Enter your prompt text here
            "prompt": "A multi-colored umbrella on the beach, disposable camera",
            "size": "1024x1024", # supported values are “1792x1024”, “1024x1024” and “1024x1792” 
            "n": 1, #The number of images to generate. Only n=1 is supported for DALL-E 3.
            "quality": "hd", # Options are “hd” and “standard”; defaults to standard 
            "style": "vivid" # Options are “natural” and “vivid”; defaults to “vivid”
        }
        submission = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=body)

        image_url = submission.json()['data'][0]['url']

        print(image_url)
        ```

        The script makes a synchronous image generation API call.

    1. Run the application with the `python` command:

        ```console
        python quickstart.py
        ```

        Wait a few moments to get the response.

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Output

The output from a successful image generation API call looks like the following example. The `url` field contains a URL where you can download the generated image. The URL stays active for 24 hours.

```json
{ 
    "created": 1698116662, 
    "data": [ 
        { 
            "url": "<URL_to_generated_image>",
            "revised_prompt": "<prompt_that_was_used>" 
        }
    ]
} 
```

A successful response includes:
- A `created` timestamp (Unix epoch time)
- A `data` array with at least one image object
- Either a `url` (temporary link valid for 24 hours) or `b64_json` (base64-encoded image data)

### Common errors

| Error | Cause | Resolution |
|-------|-------|------------|
| `DeploymentNotFound` | The deployment name doesn't exist or is misspelled | Verify the deployment name in the Azure portal or Foundry portal |
| `401 Unauthorized` | Invalid or missing API key | Check that your `AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable is set correctly |
| `429 Too Many Requests` | Rate limit exceeded | Implement retry logic with exponential backoff |
| `content_policy_violation` | Prompt or generated output blocked by content filter | Modify the prompt to comply with the content policy |
| `InvalidPayload` | Missing required parameters or invalid values | Check that `prompt`, `size`, and `n` are correctly specified |

The Image APIs come with a content moderation filter. If the service recognizes your prompt as harmful content, it doesn't generate an image. For more information, see [Content filtering](../concepts/content-filter.md). For examples of error responses, see the [Image generation how-to guide](../how-to/dall-e.md).

The system returns an operation status of `Failed` and the `error.code` value in the message is set to `contentFilter`. Here's an example:

```json
{
    "created": 1698435368,
    "error":
    {
        "code": "contentFilter",
        "message": "Your task failed as a result of our safety system."
    }
}
```

It's also possible that the generated image itself is filtered. In this case, the error message is set to `Generated image was filtered as a result of our safety system.`. Here's an example:

```json
{
    "created": 1698435368,
    "error":
    {
        "code": "contentFilter",
        "message": "Generated image was filtered as a result of our safety system."
    }
}
```

## Clean up resources

If you want to clean up and remove an Azure OpenAI resource, you can delete the resource or resource group. Deleting the resource group also deletes any other resources associated with it.

    export AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY="REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_KEY_VALUE_HERE"
    export AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT="REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_ENDPOINT_HERE"
    ```
</CodeGroup>

## Install the Python SDK

Open a command prompt and browse to your project folder. Install the OpenAI Python SDK by using the following command:

```bash
pip install openai
```

Install the following libraries as well:
```bash
pip install requests
pip install pillow 
```

## Generate images

Create a new python file, _quickstart.py_. Open it in your preferred editor or IDE.

Replace the contents of _quickstart.py_ with the following code.

```python
from openai import AzureOpenAI
import os
import requests
from PIL import Image
import json

client = AzureOpenAI(
    api_version="2024-02-01",  
    api_key=os.environ["AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY"],  
    azure_endpoint=os.environ['AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT']
)

result = client.images.generate(
    model="dalle3", # the name of your DALL-E 3 deployment
    prompt="a close-up of a bear walking through the forest",
    n=1
)

json_response = json.loads(result.model_dump_json())

# Set the directory for the stored image
image_dir = os.path.join(os.curdir, 'images')

# If the directory doesn't exist, create it
if not os.path.isdir(image_dir):
    os.mkdir(image_dir)

# Initialize the image path (note the filetype should be png)
image_path = os.path.join(image_dir, 'generated_image.png')

# Retrieve the generated image
image_url = json_response["data"][0]["url"]  # extract image URL from response
generated_image = requests.get(image_url).content  # download the image
with open(image_path, "wb") as image_file:
    image_file.write(generated_image)

# Display the image in the default image viewer
image = Image.open(image_path)
image.show()
```

1. Make sure the `AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT` and `AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variables are set.
1. Change the value of `prompt` to your preferred text.
1. Change the value of `model` to the name of your deployed DALL-E 3 model.

<Info>
Remember to remove the key from your code when you're done, and never post your key publicly. For production, use a secure way of storing and accessing your credentials. For more information, see [Azure Key Vault](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/key-vault/general/overview).
</Info>
Run the application with the `python` command:

```console
python quickstart.py
```

Wait a few moments to get the response.

## Output

Azure OpenAI stores the output image in the _generated_image.png_ file in your specified directory. The script also displays the image in your default image viewer.

A successful response includes:
- A `created` timestamp
- A `data` array with at least one image object
- Either a `url` (temporary link valid for 24 hours) or `b64_json` (base64-encoded image data)

### Common errors

| Error | Cause | Resolution |
|-------|-------|------------|
| `DeploymentNotFound` | The deployment name doesn't exist or is misspelled | Verify the deployment name in the Azure portal or Foundry portal |
| `AuthenticationError` | Invalid or missing API key | Check that your `AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable is set correctly |
| `RateLimitError` | Rate limit exceeded | Implement retry logic with exponential backoff |
| `content_policy_violation` | Prompt or generated output blocked by content filter | Modify the prompt to comply with the content policy |

The Image APIs come with a content moderation filter. If the service recognizes your prompt as harmful content, it doesn't generate an image. For more information, see [Content filtering](../concepts/content-filter.md).

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Run the quickstart

The sample code in this quickstart uses Microsoft Entra ID for the recommended keyless authentication. If you prefer to use an API key, you can replace the `DefaultAzureCredential` object with an `AzureKeyCredential` object. 

<CodeGroup>
```csharp Microsoft Entra ID
    AzureOpenAIClient openAIClient = new AzureOpenAIClient(new Uri(endpoint), new DefaultAzureCredential()); 
    ```

```csharp API key
    AzureOpenAIClient openAIClient = new AzureOpenAIClient(new Uri(endpoint), new AzureKeyCredential(key));
    ```
</CodeGroup>

To run the quickstart, follow these steps:

1. Replace the contents of `Program.cs` with the following code and update the placeholder values with your own.

    ```csharp
    using Azure;
    using Azure.AI.OpenAI;
    using OpenAI.Images;
    using static System.Environment;
    
    string endpoint = Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT") ?? "https://<your-resource-name>.openai.azure.com/";
    string key = Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY") ?? "<your-key>";
    
    // Use the recommended keyless credential instead of the AzureKeyCredential credential.
    AzureOpenAIClient openAIClient = new AzureOpenAIClient(new Uri(endpoint), new DefaultAzureCredential()); 
    //AzureOpenAIClient openAIClient = new AzureOpenAIClient(new Uri(endpoint), new AzureKeyCredential(key));
    
    // This must match the custom deployment name you chose for your model
    ImageClient chatClient = openAIClient.GetImageClient("dalle-3");
    
    var imageGeneration = await chatClient.GenerateImageAsync(
            "a happy monkey sitting in a tree, in watercolor",
            new ImageGenerationOptions()
            {
                Size = GeneratedImageSize.W1024xH1024
            }
        );
    
    Console.WriteLine(imageGeneration.Value.ImageUri);
    ```

1. Run the application using the `dotnet run` command or the run button at the top of Visual Studio:

    ```dotnetcli
    dotnet run
    ```

## Output

The URL of the generated image is printed to the console.

```console
<SAS URL>
```

<Note>
The Image APIs come with a content moderation filter. If the service recognizes your prompt as harmful content, it won't return a generated image. For more information, see the [content filter](../concepts/content-filter.md) article.
</Note>
## Clean up resources

If you want to clean up and remove an Azure OpenAI resource, you can delete the resource. Before deleting the resource, you must first delete any deployed models.

## Run the app

The sample code in this quickstart uses Microsoft Entra ID for the recommended keyless authentication. If you prefer to use an API key, you can replace the `DefaultAzureCredential` object with an `AzureKeyCredential` object. 

<CodeGroup>
```java Microsoft Entra ID
    OpenAIAsyncClient client = new OpenAIClientBuilder()
        .endpoint(endpoint)
        .credential(new DefaultAzureCredentialBuilder().build())
        .buildAsyncClient();
    ```

```java API key
    OpenAIAsyncClient client = new OpenAIClientBuilder()
        .endpoint(endpoint)
        .credential(new AzureKeyCredential(key))
        .buildAsyncClient();

Image generation result URL: <SAS URL>
Image generation result URL: <SAS URL>
```

<Note>
The Image APIs come with a content moderation filter. If the service recognizes your prompt as harmful content, it won't return a generated image. For more information, see the [content filter](../concepts/content-filter.md) article.
</Note>
## Clean up resources

If you want to clean up and remove an Azure OpenAI resource, you can delete the resource. Before deleting the resource, you must first delete any deployed models.

The URL of the generated image is printed to the console.

```console
Image generated, HEAD request on URL returned 200
Image URL: <SAS URL>
```
<Note>
The Image APIs come with a content moderation filter. If the service recognizes your prompt as harmful content, it won't return a generated image. For more information, see the [content filter](../concepts/content-filter.md) article.

## Clean up resources

If you want to clean up and remove an Azure OpenAI resource, you can delete the resource or resource group. Deleting the resource group also deletes any other resources associated with it.

- [Azure portal](../../../ai-services/multi-service-resource.md)
- [Azure CLI](../../../ai-services/multi-service-resource.md)

## Next steps

* Explore the Image APIs in more depth with the [Image API how-to guide](../how-to/dall-e.md).
* For more examples check out the [Azure OpenAI Samples GitHub repository](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/openai).

Use this guide to get started calling the Azure OpenAI in Microsoft Foundry Models image generation APIs with PowerShell.

## Prerequisites

- An Azure subscription. [Create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/purchase-options/azure-account?cid=msft_learn).
- For this task, <a href="https://aka.ms/installpowershell" target="_blank">the latest version of PowerShell 7</a> is recommended because the examples use new features not available in Windows PowerShell 5.1.
- An Azure OpenAI resource created in a supported region (see [Region availability](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-foundry/openai/concepts/models#model-summary-table-and-region-availability)). For more information, see [Create a resource and deploy a model with Azure OpenAI](../how-to/create-resource.md).

### Microsoft Entra ID prerequisites

For the recommended keyless authentication with Microsoft Entra ID, you need to:
- Install the [Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) used for keyless authentication with Microsoft Entra ID.
- Assign the `Cognitive Services User` role to your user account. You can assign roles in the Azure portal under **Access control (IAM)** > **Add role assignment**.

## Retrieve resource information

You need to retrieve the following information to authenticate your application with your Azure OpenAI resource:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Microsoft Entra ID">

    |Variable name | Value |
    |--------------------------|-------------|
    | `AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT`               | This value can be found in the **Keys and Endpoint** section when examining your resource from the Azure portal. |
    | `AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT_NAME` | This value will correspond to the custom name you chose for your deployment when you deployed a model. This value can be found under **Resource Management** > **Model Deployments** in the Azure portal.|

    Learn more about [keyless authentication](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/authentication) and [setting environment variables](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/cognitive-services-environment-variables).

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="API key">

    |Variable name | Value |
    |--------------------------|-------------|
    | `AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT`               | This value can be found in the **Keys and Endpoint** section when examining your resource from the Azure portal. |
    | `AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY` | This value can be found in the **Keys and Endpoint** section when examining your resource from the Azure portal. You can use either `KEY1` or `KEY2`.|
    | `AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT_NAME` | This value will correspond to the custom name you chose for your deployment when you deployed a model. This value can be found under **Resource Management** > **Model Deployments** in the Azure portal.|

## Generate images

1. For the **recommended** keyless authentication with Microsoft Entra ID, sign in to Azure with the following command:

    ```powershell
    az login
    ```

1. Get an Azure OpenAI auth token and set it as an environment variable for the current PowerShell session:

    ```powershell
    $Env:DEFAULT_AZURE_CREDENTIAL_TOKEN = az account get-access-token --resource https://cognitiveservices.azure.com --query accessToken -o tsv
    ```

1. Create a new PowerShell file called *quickstart.ps1*. Then open it up in your preferred editor or IDE.

1. Replace the contents of _quickstart.ps1_ with the following code. Make sure `AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT` is set, and change the value of `prompt` to your preferred text.

    To use API key authentication instead of keyless authentication, set `AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY` and uncomment the `'api-key'` line.

   ```powershell
    # Azure OpenAI metadata variables
    $openai = @{
        api_base    = $Env:AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT 
        api_version = '2023-06-01-preview' # This can change in the future.
    }
    
    # Use the recommended keyless authentication via bearer token.
    $headers = [ordered]@{
        #'api-key' = $Env:AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY
        'Authorization' = "Bearer $($Env:DEFAULT_AZURE_CREDENTIAL_TOKEN)"
    }
    
    # Text to describe image
    $prompt = 'A painting of a dog'
    
    # Adjust these values to fine-tune completions
    $body = [ordered]@{
        prompt = $prompt
        size   = '1024x1024'
        n      = 1
    } | ConvertTo-Json
    
    # Call the API to generate the image and retrieve the response
    $url = "$($openai.api_base)/openai/images/generations:submit?api-version=$($openai.api_version)"
    
    $submission = Invoke-RestMethod -Uri $url -Headers $headers -Body $body -Method Post -ContentType 'application/json' -ResponseHeadersVariable submissionHeaders
    
    $operation_location = $submissionHeaders['operation-location'][0]
    $status = ''
    while ($status -ne 'succeeded') {
        Start-Sleep -Seconds 1
        $response = Invoke-RestMethod -Uri $operation_location -Headers $headers
        $status   = $response.status
    }
    
    # Set the directory for the stored image
    $image_dir = Join-Path -Path $pwd -ChildPath 'images'
    
    # If the directory doesn't exist, create it
    if (-not(Resolve-Path $image_dir -ErrorAction Ignore)) {
        New-Item -Path $image_dir -ItemType Directory
    }
    
    # Initialize the image path (note the filetype should be png)
    $image_path = Join-Path -Path $image_dir -ChildPath 'generated_image.png'
    
    # Retrieve the generated image
    $image_url = $response.result.data[0].url  # extract image URL from response
    $generated_image = Invoke-WebRequest -Uri $image_url -OutFile $image_path  # download the image
    return $image_path
   ```

<Info>

</Info>   > For production, use a secure way of storing and accessing your credentials like [The PowerShell Secret Management with Azure Key Vault](/powershell/utility-modules/secretmanagement/how-to/using-azure-keyvault). For more information about credential security, see this [security](../../../ai-services/security-features.md) article.

1. Run the script using PowerShell:

   ```powershell
   ./quickstart.ps1
   ```

   The script loops until the generated image is ready.

## Output

PowerShell requests the image from Azure OpenAI and stores the output image in the _generated_image.png_ file in your specified directory. For convenience, the full path for the file is returned at the end of the script.

The Image APIs come with a content moderation filter. If the service recognizes your prompt as harmful content, it doesn't generate an image. For more information, see [Content filtering](../concepts/content-filter.md).

## Clean up resources

If you want to clean up and remove an Azure OpenAI resource, you can delete the resource or resource group. Deleting the resource group also deletes any other resources associated with it.
