# Azure Marketplace requirements for Foundry Models from partners

<Note>
This article refers to the [Microsoft Foundry (new)](../what-is-foundry.md#microsoft-foundry-portals) portal.
</Note>
{/* > 🔄 [Switch to the Microsoft Foundry (classic) documentation]() if you're using the classic portal. */}

Certain Microsoft Foundry Models are offered directly by the model provider through the Azure Marketplace. This article explains the requirements to use Azure Marketplace if you plan to use such models in your workloads. Models sold directly by Azure, like DeepSeek, Black Forest Labs, or Azure OpenAI in Foundry Models, don't have this requirement. 

## Permissions required to subscribe to Models from Partners and Community

[Foundry Models from partners and community](../../concepts/models-from-partners.md) available for deployment (for example, Cohere models) require Azure Marketplace. Model providers define the license terms and set the price for use of their models using Azure Marketplace.

When deploying third-party models, ensure you have the following permissions in your account:

<Check>On the Azure subscription:</Check>
<Check>`Microsoft.MarketplaceOrdering/agreements/offers/plans/read`</Check>
<Check>`Microsoft.MarketplaceOrdering/agreements/offers/plans/sign/action`</Check>
<Check>`Microsoft.MarketplaceOrdering/offerTypes/publishers/offers/plans/agreements/read`</Check>
<Check>`Microsoft.Marketplace/offerTypes/publishers/offers/plans/agreements/read`</Check>
<Check>`Microsoft.SaaS/register/action`</Check>
<Check>On the resource group—to create and use the SaaS resource:</Check>
<Check>`Microsoft.SaaS/resources/read`</Check>
<Check>`Microsoft.SaaS/resources/write`</Check>
## Country/region availability

Users can access models from partners and community with pay-as-you-go billing only if their Azure subscription belongs to a billing account in a country/region or region where the model offer is available. Availability varies per model provider and model SKU. For more information, see [Region availability for models](../../how-to/deploy-models-serverless-availability.md).

## Troubleshooting

Use the following troubleshooting guide to find and solve errors when deploying third-party models in Foundry Models:

| Error | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| This offer is not made available by the provider in the country/region where your account and Azure Subscription are registered. | The model provider didn't make the specific model SKU available in the country/region where you registered your subscription. Each model provider decides which countries/regions to make the offer available in, and availability can vary by model SKU. You need to deploy the model to a subscription with billing in a supported country/region. See the list of countries/regions at [Region availability for models](../../how-to/deploy-models-serverless-availability.md).  |
| Marketplace Subscription purchase eligibility check failed. | The model provider didn't make the specific model SKU available in the country/region where you registered your subscription, or the model isn't available in the region where you deployed the Foundry Tools resource. See [Region availability for models](../../how-to/deploy-models-serverless-availability.md). |
| Unable to create a model deployment for model "model-name". If the error persists, please contact [HIT (Human Intelligence Team)](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2101400&clcid=0x409) and request to allowlist the Azure subscription. | Azure Marketplace rejects the request to create a model subscription. This rejection can happen for multiple reasons, including subscribing to the model offering too often or from multiple subscriptions at the same time. Contact support by using the provided link and include your subscription ID. |
| This offer is not available for purchasing by subscriptions belonging to Microsoft Azure Cloud Solution Providers. | Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) subscriptions can't purchase third-party model offerings. Consider using models offered as first-party consumption service. |
