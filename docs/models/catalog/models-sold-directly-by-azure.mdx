### Capabilities

<Info>
A known issue is affecting all GPT 4.1 series models. Large tool or function call definitions that exceed 300,000 tokens will result in failures, even though the 1 million token context limit of the models wasn't reached.

The errors can vary based on API call and underlying payload characteristics.

Here are the error messages for the Chat Completions API:

- `Error code: 400 - {'error': {'message': "This model's maximum context length is 300000 tokens. However, your messages resulted in 350564 tokens (100 in the messages, 350464 in the functions). Please reduce the length of the messages or functions.", 'type': 'invalid_request_error', 'param': 'messages', 'code': 'context_length_exceeded'}}`

- `Error code: 400 - {'error': {'message': "Invalid 'tools[0].function.description': string too long. Expected a string with maximum length 1048576, but got a string with length 2778531 instead.", 'type': 'invalid_request_error', 'param': 'tools[0].function.description', 'code': 'string_above_max_length'}}`

Here's the error message for the Responses API:

- `Error code: 500 - {'error': {'message': 'The server had an error processing your request. Sorry about that! You can retry your request, or contact us through an Azure support request at: https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2213926 if you keep seeing this error. (Please include the request ID d2008353-291d-428f-adc1-defb5d9fb109 in your email.)', 'type': 'server_error', 'param': None, 'code': None}}`

## GPT-4o and GPT-4 Turbo

GPT-4o integrates text and images in a single model, which enables it to handle multiple data types simultaneously. This multimodal approach enhances accuracy and responsiveness in human-computer interactions. GPT-4o matches GPT-4 Turbo in English text and coding tasks while offering superior performance in non-English language tasks and vision tasks, setting new benchmarks for AI capabilities.

## GPT-4 and GPT-4 Turbo models

These models can be used only with the Chat Completions API.

See [Model versions](/models/catalog/model-versions) to learn about how Azure OpenAI handles model version upgrades. See [Working with models](../how-to/working-with-models.md) to learn how to view and configure the model version settings of your GPT-4 deployments.

<Danger>
We don't recommend that you use preview models in production. We'll upgrade all deployments of preview models to either future preview versions or to the latest stable, generally available version. Models that are designated preview don't follow the standard Azure OpenAI model lifecycle.

## Embeddings

 `text-embedding-3-large` is the latest and most capable embedding model. You can't upgrade between embeddings models. To move from using `text-embedding-ada-002` to `text-embedding-3-large`, you need to generate new embeddings.

- `text-embedding-3-large`
- `text-embedding-3-small`
- `text-embedding-ada-002`

OpenAI reports that testing shows that both the large and small third generation embeddings models offer better average multi-language retrieval performance with the [MIRACL](https://github.com/project-miracl/miracl) benchmark. They still maintain performance for English tasks with the [MTEB](https://github.com/embeddings-benchmark/mteb) benchmark.

|Evaluation benchmark| `text-embedding-ada-002` | `text-embedding-3-small` |`text-embedding-3-large` |
|---|---|---|---|
| MIRACL average | 31.4 | 44.0 | 54.9 |
| MTEB average | 61.0 | 62.3 | 64.6 |

The third generation embeddings models support reducing the size of the embedding via a new `dimensions` parameter. Typically, larger embeddings are more expensive from a compute, memory, and storage perspective. When you can adjust the number of dimensions, you gain more control over overall cost and performance. The `dimensions` parameter isn't supported in all versions of the OpenAI 1.x Python library. To take advantage of this parameter, we recommend that you upgrade to the latest version: `pip install openai --upgrade`.

OpenAI's MTEB benchmark testing found that even when the third generation model's dimensions are reduced to less than the 1,536 dimensions of `text-embeddings-ada-002`, performance remains slightly better.

## Image generation models

The image generation models generate images from text prompts that the user provides. GPT-image-1 series models are in limited access preview. DALL-E 3 is generally available for use with the REST APIs. DALL-E 2 and DALL-E 3 with client SDKs are in preview.

Registration is required to access `gpt-image-1`, `gpt-image-1-mini`, or `gpt-image-1.5`. Access is granted based on Microsoft's eligibility criteria. Customers who have access to other limited access models still need to request access for this model.

To request access, fill out an application form: [Apply for GPT-image-1 access](https://aka.ms/oai/gptimage1access); [Apply for GPT-image-1.5 access](https://aka.ms/oai/gptimage1.5access). When access is granted, you need to create a deployment for the model.

This table doesn't include fine-tuning regional availability information. Consult the [fine-tuning section](#fine-tuning-models) for this information.

### Embeddings models

These models can be used only with Embedding API requests.

<Note>
`text-embedding-3-large` is the latest and most capable embedding model. You can't upgrade between embedding models. To migrate from using `text-embedding-ada-002` to `text-embedding-3-large`, you need to generate new embeddings.
</Note>

|  Model ID | Max request (tokens) | Output dimensions |Training data (up to)
|---|---| :---:|:---:|:---:|
| `text-embedding-ada-002` (version 2) |8,192 | 1,536 | Sep 2021 |
| `text-embedding-ada-002` (version 1) |2,046 | 1,536 | Sep 2021 |
| `text-embedding-3-large` | 8,192 | 3,072 |Sep 2021 |
| `text-embedding-3-small` | 8,192|  1,536 | Sep 2021 |

<Note>
When you send an array of inputs for embedding, the maximum number of input items in the array per call to the embedding endpoint is 2,048.
</Note>

### Image generation models

|  Model ID  | Max request (characters) |
|  --- | :---: |
| `gpt-image-1` | 4,000 |
| `gpt-image-1-mini` | 4,000 |

## Fine-tuning models

<Note>
The supported regions for fine-tuning might vary if you use Azure OpenAI models in a Microsoft Foundry project versus outside a project.

| Model  | Type | Capabilities | Deployment type (region availability) |
| ------ | ---- | ------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| [model-router](https://ai.azure.com/resource/models/model-router/version/2025-11-18/registry/azureml-routers/?cid=learnDocs)<sup>1</sup> | chat-completion | More details in [Model router overview](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-foundry/openai/how-to/model-router). <br /> - **Input:** text, image <br /> - **Output:** text (max output tokens varies<sup>2</sup>) <br /> **Context window:** 200,000<sup>3</sup> <br /> - **Languages:** `en` |- Global standard (East US 2, Sweden Central) <br /> - Data Zone standard<sup>4</sup> (East US 2, Sweden Central) |
| `MAI-DS-R1` | chat-completion <br /> [(with reasoning content)](../how-to/use-chat-reasoning.md) | - **Input:** text (163,840 tokens) <br /> - **Output:** text (163,840 tokens) <br /> - **Languages:** `en` and `zh` <br />  - **Tool calling:** No <br /> - **Response formats:** Text |- Global standard (all regions) |

<sup>1</sup> **Model router version** `2025-11-18`. Earlier versions (`2025-08-07` and `2025-05-19`) are also available. 

<sup>2</sup> **Max output tokens** varies for underlying models in the model router. For example, 32,768 (`GPT-4.1 series`), 100,000 (`o4-mini`), 128,000 (`gpt-5 reasoning models`), and 16,384 (`gpt-5-chat`).

<sup>3</sup> Larger **context windows** are compatible with *some* of the underlying models of the Model Router. That means an API call with a larger context succeeds only if the prompt gets routed to one of such models. Otherwise, the call fails.

<sup>4</sup> Billing for **Data Zone Standard** model router deployments begins no earlier than November 1, 2025.

## Model region availability by deployment type

Foundry Models gives you choices for the hosting structure that fits your business and usage patterns. The service offers two main types of deployment:

- **Standard**: Has a global deployment option, routing traffic globally to provide higher throughput.
- **Provisioned**: Also has a global deployment option, allowing you to purchase and deploy provisioned throughput units across Azure global infrastructure.

All deployments perform the same inference operations, but the billing, scale, and performance differ. For more information about deployment types, see [Deployment types in Foundry Models](/models/capabilities/deployment-types).
