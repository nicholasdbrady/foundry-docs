# Quickstart: Speech to text with the Azure OpenAI Whisper model

<Note>
This article refers to the [Microsoft Foundry (new)](/overview/what-is-foundry#microsoft-foundry-portals) portal.
</Note><!-- > 🔄 [Switch to the Microsoft Foundry (classic) documentation]() if you're using the classic portal. -->

In this quickstart, you transcribe speech to text using the [Azure OpenAI Whisper model](../../ai-services/speech-service/whisper-overview.md). The Whisper model can transcribe human speech in numerous languages and translate other languages into English.

<Tip>
This quickstart takes approximately 10-15 minutes to complete.
</Tip>
## Prerequisites

- An Azure subscription - [Create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/purchase-options/azure-account?cid=msft_learn).
- An Azure OpenAI resource with a speech to text model deployed in a [supported region](../../foundry-models/concepts/models-sold-directly-by-azure.md). For more information, see [Create a resource and deploy a model with Azure OpenAI](../how-to/create-resource.md).
- Be sure that you are assigned at least the [Cognitive Services Contributor](../how-to/role-based-access-control.md#cognitive-services-contributor) role for the Azure OpenAI resource.
- A sample audio file. You can get sample audio, such as *wikipediaOcelot.wav*, from the [Azure Speech in Foundry Tools SDK repository at GitHub](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-speech-sdk/tree/master/sampledata/audiofiles).

## Setup

### Retrieve key and endpoint

To successfully make a call against Azure OpenAI, you need an *endpoint* and a *key*.

|Variable name | Value |
|--------------------------|-------------|
| `AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT`               | The service endpoint can be found in the **Keys & Endpoint** section when examining your resource from the Azure portal. Alternatively, you can find the endpoint via the **Deployments** page in Microsoft Foundry portal. An example endpoint is: `https://docs-test-001.openai.azure.com/`.|
| `AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY` | This value can be found in the **Keys & Endpoint** section when examining your resource from the Azure portal. You can use either `KEY1` or `KEY2`.|

Go to your resource in the Azure portal. The **Endpoint and Keys** can be found in the **Resource Management** section. Copy your endpoint and access key as you need both for authenticating your API calls. You can use either `KEY1` or `KEY2`. Always having two keys allows you to securely rotate and regenerate keys without causing a service disruption.

  <img src="/images/endpoint.png" alt="Screenshot of the overview UI for an Azure OpenAI resource in the Azure portal with the endpoint & access keys location circled in red." />
</Frame>

### Environment variables

Create and assign persistent environment variables for your key and endpoint.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Command Line">

    ```CMD
    setx AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY "REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_KEY_VALUE_HERE" 
    ```

    ```CMD
    setx AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT "REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_ENDPOINT_HERE" 
    ```

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="PowerShell">

    ```powershell
    [System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable('AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY', 'REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_KEY_VALUE_HERE', 'User')
    ```

    ```powershell
    [System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable('AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT', 'REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_ENDPOINT_HERE', 'User')
    ```

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Bash">

    ```Bash
    echo export AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY="REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_KEY_VALUE_HERE" >> /etc/environment && source /etc/environment
    ```

    ```Bash
    echo export AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT="REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_ENDPOINT_HERE" >> /etc/environment && source /etc/environment
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Create a REST API request and response

In a bash shell, run the following command. You need to replace `YourDeploymentName` with the deployment name you chose when you deployed the Whisper model. The deployment name isn't necessarily the same as the model name. Entering the model name results in an error unless you chose a deployment name that's identical to the underlying model name.

```bash
curl $AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT/openai/deployments/YourDeploymentName/audio/transcriptions?api-version=2024-02-01 \
 -H "api-key: $AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY" \
 -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data" \
 -F file="@./wikipediaOcelot.wav"
```

The first line of the preceding command with an example endpoint would appear as follows:

```bash
curl https://aoai-docs.openai.azure.com/openai/deployments/{YourDeploymentName}/audio/transcriptions?api-version=2024-02-01 \
```

<Info>
For production, store and access your credentials using a secure method, such as [Azure Key Vault](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/key-vault/general/overview). For more information, see [credential security](../../../ai-services/security-features.md).
</Info>
## Verify the output

The response contains a `text` field with the complete transcription of your audio file. You should see output similar to the example below. If you encounter errors:
- Verify your deployment name matches exactly
- Check that your audio file path is correct
- Ensure your API key and endpoint are valid

## Output

```bash
{"text":"The ocelot, Lepardus paradalis, is a small wild cat native to the southwestern United States, Mexico, and Central and South America. This medium-sized cat is characterized by solid black spots and streaks on its coat, round ears, and white neck and undersides. It weighs between 8 and 15.5 kilograms, 18 and 34 pounds, and reaches 40 to 50 centimeters 16 to 20 inches at the shoulders. It was first described by Carl Linnaeus in 1758. Two subspecies are recognized, L. p. paradalis and L. p. mitis. Typically active during twilight and at night, the ocelot tends to be solitary and territorial. It is efficient at climbing, leaping, and swimming. It preys on small terrestrial mammals such as armadillo, opossum, and lagomorphs."}

    using Azure;
    using Azure.AI.OpenAI;
    using Azure.Identity; // Required for Passwordless auth
    
    
    string deploymentName = "whisper";
    
    string endpoint = Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT") ?? "https://<your-resource-name>.openai.azure.com/";
    string key = Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY") ?? "<your-key>";
    
    // Use the recommended keyless credential instead of the AzureKeyCredential credential.
    AzureOpenAIClient openAIClient = new AzureOpenAIClient(new Uri(endpoint), new DefaultAzureCredential()); 
    //AzureOpenAIClient openAIClient = new AzureOpenAIClient(new Uri(endpoint), new AzureKeyCredential(key));
    
    var audioFilePath = "<audio file path>"
    
    var audioClient = openAIClient.GetAudioClient(deploymentName);
    
    var result = await audioClient.TranscribeAudioAsync(audioFilePath);
    
    Console.WriteLine("Transcribed text:");
    foreach (var item in result.Value.Text)
    {
        Console.Write(item);
    }
    ```

1. Run the application using the `dotnet run` command or the run button at the top of Visual Studio:

    ```dotnetcli
    dotnet run
    ```

## Verify the output

The transcription returns a response with a `Text` property containing the complete transcription of your audio file. You should see output similar to the example below. If you encounter errors:
- Verify your deployment name matches exactly
- Check that your audio file path is correct
- Ensure your API key and endpoint are valid

## Output

If you are using the sample audio file, you should see the following text printed out in the console:

```text
The ocelot, Lepardus paradalis, is a small wild cat native to the southwestern United States, 
Mexico, and Central and South America. This medium-sized cat is characterized by solid 
black spots and streaks on its coat, round ears...

    import { DefaultAzureCredential, getBearerTokenProvider } from "@azure/identity";

    // You will need to set these environment variables or edit the following values
    const audioFilePath = "<audio file path>";
    const endpoint = process.env.AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT || "Your endpoint";
    
    // Required Azure OpenAI deployment name and API version
    const apiVersion = process.env.OPENAI_API_VERSION || "2024-08-01-preview";
    const deploymentName = process.env.AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT_NAME || "whisper";

    // keyless authentication    
    const credential = new DefaultAzureCredential();

You can get sample audio files, such as *wikipediaOcelot.wav*, from the [Azure Speech in Foundry Tools SDK repository at GitHub](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-speech-sdk/tree/master/sampledata/audiofiles).

## Output

```json
{"text":"The ocelot, Lepardus paradalis, is a small wild cat native to the southwestern United States, Mexico, and Central and South America. This medium-sized cat is characterized by solid black spots and streaks on its coat, round ears, and white neck and undersides.

## Prerequisites

- An Azure subscription - [Create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/purchase-options/azure-account?cid=msft_learn)
- <a href="https://aka.ms/installpowershell" target="_blank">You can use either the latest version, PowerShell 7, or Windows PowerShell 5.1.</a>
- An Azure OpenAI resource with a speech to text model deployed in a [supported region](../../foundry-models/concepts/models-sold-directly-by-azure.md). For more information, see [Create a resource and deploy a model with Azure OpenAI](../how-to/create-resource.md).

## Set up

### Retrieve key and endpoint

To successfully make a call against Azure OpenAI, you need an *endpoint* and a *key*.

|Variable name | Value |
|--------------------------|-------------|
| `AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT`               | The service endpoint can be found in the **Keys & Endpoint** section when examining your resource from the Azure portal. Alternatively, you can find the endpoint via the **Deployments** page in Microsoft Foundry portal. An example endpoint is: `https://docs-test-001.openai.azure.com/`.|
| `AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY` | This value can be found in the **Keys & Endpoint** section when examining your resource from the Azure portal. You can use either `KEY1` or `KEY2`.|

Go to your resource in the Azure portal. The **Endpoint and Keys** can be found in the **Resource Management** section. Copy your endpoint and access key as you'll need both for authenticating your API calls. You can use either `KEY1` or `KEY2`. Always having two keys allows you to securely rotate and regenerate keys without causing a service disruption.

### Environment variables

Create and assign persistent environment variables for your key and endpoint.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Command Line">

    ```CMD
    setx AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY "REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_KEY_VALUE_HERE" 
    ```

    ```CMD
    setx AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT "REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_ENDPOINT_HERE" 
    ```

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="PowerShell">

    ```powershell
    [System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable('AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY', 'REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_KEY_VALUE_HERE', 'User')
    ```

    ```powershell
    [System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable('AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT', 'REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_ENDPOINT_HERE', 'User')
    ```

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Bash">

    ```Bash
    echo export AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY="REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_KEY_VALUE_HERE" >> /etc/environment && source /etc/environment
    ```

    ```Bash
    echo export AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT="REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_ENDPOINT_HERE" >> /etc/environment && source /etc/environment
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Create a PowerShell app

Run the following command. You need to replace `YourDeploymentName` with the deployment name you chose when you deployed the Whisper model. The deployment name isn't necessarily the same as the model name. Entering the model name results in an error unless you chose a deployment name that is identical to the underlying model name.

```powershell-interactive
# Azure OpenAI metadata variables
$openai = @{
    api_key     = $Env:AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY
    api_base    = $Env:AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT # your endpoint should look like the following https://YOUR_RESOURCE_NAME.openai.azure.com/
    api_version = '2024-02-01' # this may change in the future
    name        = 'YourDeploymentName' #This will correspond to the custom name you chose for your deployment when you deployed a model.
}

# Header for authentication
$headers = [ordered]@{
    'api-key' = $openai.api_key
}

$form = @{ file = get-item -path './wikipediaOcelot.wav' }

# Send a completion call to generate an answer
$url = "$($openai.api_base)/openai/deployments/$($openai.name)/audio/transcriptions?api-version=$($openai.api_version)"

$response = Invoke-RestMethod -Uri $url -Headers $headers -Form $form -Method Post -ContentType 'multipart/form-data'
return $response.text
```

<Note>
For information about other audio models that you can use with Azure OpenAI, see [Audio models](/models/catalog/models-sold-directly-by-azure).
</Note>
<Tip>
The file size limit for the Whisper model is 25 MB. If you need to transcribe a file larger than 25 MB, you can use the Azure Speech in Foundry Tools [batch transcription](../../ai-services/speech-service/batch-transcription-create.md#use-a-whisper-model) API.
</Tip>
## Troubleshooting

### Authentication errors

If you receive 401 Unauthorized errors, verify:
- Your API key is correctly set in environment variables
- Your Azure OpenAI resource is active
- Your account has the Cognitive Services Contributor role

### File format errors

The Whisper model supports mp3, mp4, mpeg, mpga, m4a, wav, and webm formats. Other formats return an error.

### File size limit

Audio files must be 25 MB or smaller. For larger files, use the [Azure Speech batch transcription API](../../ai-services/speech-service/batch-transcription-create.md#use-a-whisper-model).

### Deployment not found

Verify your deployment name matches exactly what you created in Azure OpenAI Studio. Deployment names are case-sensitive.

## Clean up resources

If you want to clean up and remove an Azure OpenAI resource, you can delete the resource. Before deleting the resource, you must first delete any deployed models.

- [Azure portal](/setup/multi-service-resource)
- [Azure CLI](/setup/multi-service-resource)
