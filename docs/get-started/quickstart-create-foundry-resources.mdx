# Quickstart: Set up Microsoft Foundry resources

In this quickstart, you create a [Microsoft Foundry](https://ai.azure.com) project and deploy a model. If you're managing a team, you also grant access to team members. After you complete these steps, you or your team can start building AI applications using the deployed model.

<Tip>
This quickstart shows you how to create resources to build an agent with a basic setup. For more advanced scenarios that use your own resources, see [Set up your environment for agent development](/setup/environment-setup).
</Tip>
## Prerequisites

- An Azure account with an active subscription. If you don't have one, create a [free Azure account, which includes a free trial subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/purchase-options/azure-account?cid=msft_learn).
- If you're creating the project for yourself: 
    - Access to a role that allows you to create a Foundry resource, such as **Azure Account AI Owner** or **Azure AI Owner** on the subscription or resource group. For more information about permissions, see [Role-based access control for Microsoft Foundry](../concepts/rbac-foundry.md#permissions-for-each-built-in-role).
- If you're creating the project for a team: 
    - Access to a role that allows you to complete role assignments, such as **Owner**. For more information about permissions, see [Role-based access control for Microsoft Foundry](../concepts/rbac-foundry.md#permissions-for-each-built-in-role).
    - A list of user email addresses or Microsoft Entra security group IDs for team members who need access.

Select your preferred method by using the following tabs:

## Create a project

Create a Foundry project to organize your work. The project contains models, agents, and other resources your team uses.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Azure CLI">

    1. Create a resource group or use an existing one. For example, create `my-foundry-rg` in `eastus`:

       ```azurecli
       az group create --name my-foundry-rg --location eastus
       ```

    1. Create the Foundry resource. For example, create `my-foundry-resource` in the `my-foundry-rg` resource group:

       ```azurecli
       az cognitiveservices account create \
           --name my-foundry-resource \
           --resource-group my-foundry-rg \
           --kind AIServices \
           --sku s0 \
           --location eastus \
          --allow-project-management
       ```

       The `--allow-project-management` flag enables project creation within this resource.

    1. Create a custom subdomain for the resource. The custom domain name must be globally unique. If `my-foundry-resource` is taken, try a more unique name.

       ```azurecli
       az cognitiveservices account update \
           --name my-foundry-resource \
           --resource-group my-foundry-rg \
           --custom-domain my-foundry-resource
       ```

    1. Create the project. For example, create `my-foundry-project` in the `my-foundry-resource`:

       ```azurecli
       az cognitiveservices account project create \
           --name my-foundry-resource \
           --resource-group my-foundry-rg \
           --project-name my-foundry-project \
           --location eastus
       ```

    1. Verify the project was created:

       ```azurecli
       az cognitiveservices account project show \
           --name my-foundry-resource \
           --resource-group my-foundry-rg \
           --project-name my-foundry-project
       ```

       The output displays the project properties, including its resource ID.

    Reference: [az cognitiveservices account](https://learn.microsoft.com/cli/azure/cognitiveservices/account)

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Foundry portal">

    1. Go to [Microsoft Foundry](https://ai.azure.com).
    1. Sign in with your Azure account.
    1. Select the project name in the upper-left corner, and then select **Create new project**.
    1. Enter a project name, such as `my-foundry-project`.
    1. Select **Advanced options** to configure the resource group and location:
       - **Resource group**: Create a new resource group or select an existing one. If you create a new resource group, you can more easily manage the project and all its resources together.
       - **Location**: Select the region closest to your team.
    1. Select **Create project**.

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Deploy a model

Deploy a model that you can use. This example uses **gpt-4.1-mini**, but you can choose any available model.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Azure CLI">

    ```azurecli
    az cognitiveservices account deployment create \
        --name my-foundry-resource \
        --resource-group my-foundry-rg \
        --deployment-name gpt-4.1-mini \
        --model-name gpt-4.1-mini \
        --model-version "2025-04-14" \
        --model-format OpenAI \
        --sku-capacity 10 \
        --sku-name Standard
    ```

    Verify the deployment succeeded:

    ```azurecli
    az cognitiveservices account deployment show \
        --name my-foundry-resource \
        --resource-group my-foundry-rg \
        --deployment-name gpt-4.1-mini
    ```

    When the deployment is ready, the output shows `"provisioningState": "Succeeded"`.

    Reference: [az cognitiveservices account deployment](https://learn.microsoft.com/cli/azure/cognitiveservices/account/deployment)

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Foundry portal">

    1. In your project, select **Discover** in the upper-right navigation.
    1. Select **Models**.
    1. Search for **gpt-4.1-mini**.
    1. Select **Deploy** > **Default settings** to add it to your project.
    1. Note the deployment name (for example, `gpt-4.1-mini`). Your team needs this name to use the model.

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Get your project connection details

You need the following information to connect to the project in other quickstarts and tutorials. 

If you're administering this project for others, send them this information.

* Sign in to [Microsoft Foundry](https://ai.azure.com/?cid=learnDocs) by using your Azure account. Select your project to start building.
* Find your project endpoint on the welcome screen of the project. 

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/project-endpoint.png" alt="Screenshot of Microsoft Foundry Models welcome screen showing the endpoint URL and copy button." />
</Frame>
* Get started with [Microsoft Foundry quickstart](/get-started/get-started-code).

## For administrators - grant access

If you're administering a team, assign the **Azure AI User** role to team members so they can use the project and deployed models. This role provides the minimum permissions needed to build and test AI applications.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Azure CLI">

    1. Get the project's resource ID:

         ```azurecli
       PROJECT_ID=$(az cognitiveservices account project show \
           --name my-foundry-resource \
           --resource-group my-foundry-rg \
           --project-name my-foundry-project \
           --query id -o tsv)
       ```

    1. Assign the **Azure AI User** role to a team member:

       ```azurecli
       az role assignment create \
           --role "Azure AI User" \
           --assignee "user@contoso.com" \
           --scope $PROJECT_ID
       ```

       To add a security group instead of an individual user:

       ```azurecli
       az role assignment create \
           --role "Azure AI User" \
           --assignee-object-id "<security-group-object-id>" \
           --assignee-principal-type Group \
           --scope $PROJECT_ID
       ```

    1. Verify the role assignment:

       ```azurecli
       az role assignment list \
           --scope $PROJECT_ID \
           --role "Azure AI User" \
           --output table
       ```

    Reference: [az role assignment](https://learn.microsoft.com/cli/azure/role/assignment) 

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Foundry portal">

    1. In the Foundry portal, select **Operate** in the upper-right navigation.
    1. Select **Admin** in the left pane.
    1. Select your project name in the table.
    1. Select **Add user** in the upper right.
    1. Enter the email address of the team member.
    1. Select **Add**.

    Repeat these steps for each team member or security group.

    <Tip>
    To add multiple users at once, use a Microsoft Entra security group instead of individual email addresses.
    </Tip>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Verify team member access

Ask a team member to verify their access by signing in to [Microsoft Foundry](https://ai.azure.com), selecting the project from the project list, and confirming the deployed model appears under **Build** > **Models**.

If the team member can't access the project, verify that the role assignment completed successfully. Check that you used the correct email address or security group ID. Make sure the team member's Azure account is in the same Microsoft Entra tenant.

## Clean up resources

When you no longer want this project, delete the resource group to delete all resources associated with it.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Azure CLI">

    ```azurecli
    az group delete --name my-foundry-rg --yes --no-wait
    ```

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Foundry portal">

    In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), find and select your resource group. Select **Delete** and confirm to delete the resource group and all its associated resources.

  </Tab>
</Tabs>
