In this quickstart, you use [Microsoft Foundry](https://ai.azure.com/?cid=learnDocs) to interact with a Foundry model, create, and chat with an agent.

## Prerequisites

* A model deployed in Microsoft Foundry. If you don't have a model, first complete [Quickstart: Set up Microsoft Foundry resources](../tutorials/quickstart-create-foundry-resources.md).
* The required language runtimes, global tools, and Visual Studio Code extensions as described in [Prepare your development environment](../../how-to/develop/install-cli-sdk.md).

## Set environment variables and get the code

Store [your project endpoint](../tutorials/quickstart-create-foundry-resources.md#get-your-project-connection-details) as an environment variable. Also set these values for use in your scripts.

```plaintext
PROJECT_ENDPOINT=<endpoint copied from welcome screen>
AGENT_NAME="MyAgent"
MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME="gpt-4.1-mini"
```
