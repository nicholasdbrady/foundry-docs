You can use Foundry Control Plane for the following tasks.

### Manage your fleet across Foundry, Microsoft, and non-Microsoft agents in one place

- Track key performance indicators such as active agents, run completion, compliance posture, cost efficiency, and prohibited behaviors across [supported agent platforms](/manage/how-to-manage-agents#supported-agent-platforms).

- Use deep links to evaluation and monitoring experiences for rapid debugging, diagnosis, and remediation.

- Visualize fleet health through intuitive dashboards that surface trends and anomalies instantly.

### Observe, protect, and improve

- Correlate alerts, evaluation results, and trace data to pinpoint problems instantly.

- [Continuously evaluate](../../how-to/continuous-evaluation-agents.md) agent performance, quality, and risk dimensions. Risk dimensions might include [task adherence, intent resolution, tool call success](/observability/agent-evaluators), [groundedness](/observability/rag-evaluators), sensitive data leakage, and exposure to jailbreak and cross-domain prompt injection attacks (XPIAs).

- Use the [AI Red Teaming Agent](/observability/ai-red-teaming-agent) and [cluster analysis](/observability/cluster-analysis) for automated vulnerability probing and error root-cause discovery.

- View recommendations for prompt refinements, model version upgrades, and configuration changes.

### Govern and enforce with guardrails

- Define enterprise-wide guardrail policies for safety, compliance, and quality.

- Apply bulk remediation to instantly correct noncompliant configurations across your fleet.

### Secure agents

- Schedule automated red-teaming scans and drift monitoring for ongoing agent testing.

- View Defender and Microsoft Purview alerts directly on the Foundry Control Plane dashboard.

- Track rate limits, token usage, and cost anomalies to prevent inefficiency or abuse.

## Key features

The Foundry Control Plane experience begins when you select **Operate** on the upper-right toolbar of the Foundry workspace. From **Operate**, you can monitor, govern, and optimize every agent, model, and deployment within your subscription.

Each pane within **Operate** is designed around a specific job to be done. These panes help various roles, from builders to administrators, manage AI systems confidently at scale.

### Overview

Use the **Overview** pane to understand fleet health, performance, and compliance at a glance.

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/control-plane-overview.gif" alt="Animation of the Overview pane that displays trend-based health scores, alert summaries, and aggregated compliance metrics for a fleet." />
</Frame>

This pane provides a high-level snapshot of your AI estate by aggregating key operational and compliance metrics in one view. You can:

- View key statistics such as active agents, cost trends, run completion rate, and prevented behaviors.
- Drill into anomalies or cost spikes through contextual charts and direct links to inventory, observability, or policy information.
- Identify potential risks early by using trend-based health scores and alert summaries.

### Assets

Use the **Assets** pane to track, analyze, and manage every agent, model, and tool from one place.

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/assets-view.png" alt="Screenshot of an agent inventory table with filters and sort options applied to display metadata and health indicators for AI assets." />
</Frame>

This pane provides a unified, searchable table of all AI assets across projects within a subscription. It brings together critical metadata and health indicators, so you can assess and act on your AI estate efficiently. You can:

- Filter and sort by key attributes such as version, tags, health score (percentage), cost, alerts, and token usage to locate assets quickly.
- Drill down from any entry in the agent inventory table into the [Evaluation](../../how-to/continuous-evaluation-agents.md) or [Monitoring](../../how-to/monitor-applications.md) tab for pre-deployment and post-deployment insights.
- Surface inline recommendations to refine prompts, upgrade models, or optimize configurations based on performance and cost signals.
- Correlate runtime logs with evaluation results to uncover root causes of errors or performance degradation.
- Visualize drift, latency, and error clusters across runs or builds to detect emerging issues early.
- Integrate with the [AI Red Teaming Agent](/observability/ai-red-teaming-agent) to automate vulnerability probing, regression testing, and issue reproduction.
- Observe and modify model and agent guardrails.

Together, these capabilities turn the **Assets** pane into the operational backbone of Foundry Control Plane. It's a single pane where you can understand, improve, and secure every AI asset in your environment.

### Compliance

Use the **Compliance** pane to govern your AI systems and enforce the right guardrails.

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/compliance.png" alt="Screenshot of the Compliance pane that shows options to define, apply, and monitor AI compliance policies with Azure Policy, Microsoft Defender, and Microsoft Purview integrations." />
</Frame>

The **Compliance** pane lets you define, apply, and continuously monitor guardrails and compliance policies across your AI estate. It provides a unified interface to operationalize responsible AI principles while helping to ensure enterprise-grade safety and regulatory alignment. You can:

- Define and enforce protections through deep integrations with Azure Policy, Defender, and Microsoft Purview. These integrations help ensure that identity, data, and threat safeguards work in concert.
- Apply versioned policies and track assignments to maintain full auditability and traceability across agents and environments.
- Monitor compliance posture in real time, so that you can surface noncompliant assets and enable bulk remediation directly from Foundry Control Plane.

Policy management in Foundry enables administrators and developers alike to embed quality and safety requirements into the development and deployment lifecycle. These policies help ensure that all models operate safely and adhere to organizational and regulatory standards.

### Quota

Use the **Quota** pane to view, adjust, and request quotas.

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/quota-view.png" alt="Screenshot of the Quota pane that shows model deployments, their quota usage, and usage patterns with options to adjust or request additional quotas." />
</Frame>

The **Quota** pane shows your model deployments and how much quota each deployment is consuming. It gives insights into usage patterns and helps you manage resources effectively.

### Admin

Use the **Admin** pane to view, organize, and administer all projects, users, and connected resources across your Foundry environment.

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/admin-tab-overview.png" alt="Screenshot of the Admin pane that shows a list of projects with details like owners, region, connected services, and compliance status." />
</Frame>

This pane extends your operational view beyond a single project. Most work in Foundry happens within a project context. The **Admin** pane provides an enterprise-level lens to oversee and configure multiple projects, user permissions, and linked Azure resources from one place.

From **Admin**, administrators and power users can:

- Gain visibility into all projects across their subscription or tenant, including active, inactive, and archived workspaces.
- View detailed project information such as owners, region, connected services, and compliance posture.
- Add or remove users directly from a project, to define granular access levels aligned with organizational roles.
- Attach or manage connected resources, such as storage accounts, compute clusters, and Foundry Tools, so that projects remain properly provisioned.
- Assign access at parent scope (subscription or resource group) to apply consistent governance and permissions inheritance across multiple projects.

Together, these capabilities make **Admin** the administrative backbone of Foundry Control Plane. It's a centralized console to help ensure that every Foundry project remains properly configured, compliant, and connected to the right people and infrastructure.
