# Quickstart: Set up your first Foundry resource

In this quickstart, you create a Microsoft Foundry resource and verify access.

Learn how to create and manage a Foundry resource. It's the [primary Azure resource type](../ai-foundry/concepts/resource-types.md) for building, deploying, and managing generative AI models and applications including agents in Azure.

An Azure resource is required to use and manage services in Azure. It defines the scope for configuring access, security such as networking, billing, and monitoring. 

Foundry resource is the next version and renaming of former "Foundry Tools". It provides the application environment for hosting your agents, model deployments, evaluations, and more.

A Foundry resource can organize the work for multiple use cases, and is [typically shared](/setup/planning) between a team of developers that work on use cases in a similar business or data domain. Projects act as folders to group related work. 

![Diagram showing Foundry resource containing multiple projects, each with deployments and connections.](/images/projects-multi-setup.png)

<Note>
Only the default project is available in the Foundry (new) portal. Use the Foundry (classic) portal to interact with all other projects on a Foundry resource.
</Note>
Looking to configure Foundry with advanced security settings? See [advanced Foundry creation options](/setup/create-resource-template)

## Create your first resource

To create your first resource, with basic Azure settings, follow the below steps using either Azure portal, Azure CLI, or PowerShell.

## Prerequisites

* A valid Azure subscription - [Create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/purchase-options/azure-account?cid=msft_learn).
* Azure RBAC role to create resources. You need one of the following roles assigned on your Azure subscription or resource group:
  * Contributor
  * Owner
  * Custom role with `Microsoft.CognitiveServices/accounts/write` permission

## Create a new Microsoft Foundry resource

If your organization requires customized Azure configurations like alternative names, security controls or cost tags, you might need to use the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) or [template options](../../../ai-foundry/how-to/create-resource-template.md) to comply with your organization's Azure Policy compliance.

The Foundry resource is listed under **Foundry** > **Foundry** in the Azure portal. The API kind is **AIServices**. Look for the logo as shown here:

![Screenshot of the Foundry resource in the Azure portal.](/images/ai-services-resource-portal.png)

<Tip>
[Foundry portal](https://ai.azure.com/?cid=learnDocs) provides a way to [create a new Foundry resource](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-foundry/how-to/create-projects) with basic, defaulted, settings.
</Tip>
To create a Foundry resource in the Azure portal follow these instructions:

1. Select this **Foundry** resource link: [https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.CognitiveServicesAIFoundry](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.CognitiveServicesAIFoundry)

1. On the **Create** page, provide the following information:

    |Project details| Description   |
    |--|--|
    | **Subscription** | Select one of your available Azure subscriptions. |
    | **Resource group** | The Azure resource group that will contain your Foundry resource. You can create a new group or add it to a preexisting group. |
    | **Region** | The location of your Foundry Tool instance. Different locations may introduce latency, but have no impact on the runtime availability of your resource. |
    | **Name** | A descriptive name for your Foundry resource. For example, *MyAIServicesResource*. |

1. Configure other settings for your resource as needed, read and accept the conditions (as applicable), and then select **Review + create**.

<Tip>
If your subscription doesn't allow you to create a Foundry resource, you might need to enable the privilege of that [Azure resource provider](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/resource-providers-and-types#register-resource-provider) using the [Azure portal](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/resource-providers-and-types#azure-portal), [PowerShell command](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/resource-providers-and-types#azure-powershell) or an [Azure CLI command](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/resource-providers-and-types#azure-cli). If you are not the subscription owner, ask someone with the role of *Owner* or *Admin* to complete the registration for you or ask for the **/register/action** privileges to be granted to your account.
</Tip>
## Clean up resources

If you want to clean up and remove a Foundry resource, you can delete the resource or resource group. Deleting the resource group also deletes any other resources contained in the group.

1. In the Azure portal, expand the menu on the left side to open the menu of services, and choose **Resource Groups** to display the list of your resource groups.
1. Locate the resource group containing the resource to be deleted.
1. If you want to delete the entire resource group, select the resource group name. On the next page, Select **Delete resource group**, and confirm.
1. If you want to delete only the Foundry resource, select the resource group to see all the resources within it. On the next page, select the resource that you want to delete, select the ellipsis menu for that row, and select **Delete**.

Use this quickstart to create a Foundry resource using [Azure Command-Line Interface (CLI)](https://learn.microsoft.com/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) commands. 

## Prerequisites

* A valid Azure subscription - [Create one](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/purchase-options/azure-account?cid=msft_learn) for free.
* The [Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) version 2.0 or later.
* Azure RBAC role to create resources. You need one of the following roles assigned on your Azure subscription or resource group:
  * Contributor
  * Owner
  * Custom role with `Microsoft.CognitiveServices/accounts/write` permission

## Install the Azure CLI and sign in

Install the [Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/cli/azure/install-azure-cli). To sign into your local installation of the CLI, run the [az login](https://learn.microsoft.com/cli/azure/reference-index#az-login) command:

```azurecli-interactive
az login
```

## Create a new resource group

Before you create a Foundry resource, you must have an Azure resource group to contain the resource. When you create a new resource, you can either create a new resource group, or use an existing one. This article shows how to create a new resource group.

To create a resource, you'll need one of the Azure locations available for your subscription. You can retrieve a list of available locations with the [az account list-locations](https://learn.microsoft.com/cli/azure/account#az-account-list-locations) command. Most Foundry Tools can be accessed from several locations. Choose the one closest to you, or see which locations are available for the service.

<Warning>
* Remember your Azure location, as you will need it when calling the Microsoft Foundry resources.
* The availability of some Foundry Tools can vary by region. For more information, see [Azure products by region](https://azure.microsoft.com/global-infrastructure/services/?products=cognitive-services).
</Warning>
```azurecli-interactive
az account list-locations --query "[].{Region:name}" --out table
```

After you have your Azure location, create a new resource group in the Azure CLI using the [az group create](https://learn.microsoft.com/cli/azure/group#az-group-create) command. In the example below, replace the Azure location `westus2` with one of the Azure locations available for your subscription.

```azurecli-interactive
az group create --name ai-services-resource-group --location westus2
```

## Create a Foundry resource

To create and subscribe to a new Foundry resource, use the [az cognitiveservices account create](https://learn.microsoft.com/cli/azure/cognitiveservices/account#az-cognitiveservices-account-create) command. This command adds a new billable resource to the resource group you created earlier. When you create your new resource, you'll need to know the kind of service you want to use, along with its pricing tier (or SKU) and an Azure location.

<Warning>
Azure provides more than one resource kinds for Foundry Tools. Be sure to create one with the `kind` of `AIServices`.
</Warning>
You can create a Foundry resource named `foundry-multi-service-resource` with the command below.

```azurecli-interactive
az cognitiveservices account create --name foundry-multi-service-resource --resource-group ai-services-resource-group  --kind AIServices --sku S0 --location westus2 --yes
```

<Tip>
If your subscription doesn't allow you to create a Foundry resource, you might need to enable the privilege of that [Azure resource provider](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/resource-providers-and-types#register-resource-provider) using the [Azure portal](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/resource-providers-and-types#azure-portal), [PowerShell command](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/resource-providers-and-types#azure-powershell) or an [Azure CLI command](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/resource-providers-and-types#azure-cli). If you are not the subscription owner, ask someone with the role of *Owner* or *Admin* to complete the registration for you or ask for the **/register/action** privileges to be granted to your account.
</Tip>
## Get current quota usage for your resource

Use the [az cognitiveservices account list-usage](https://learn.microsoft.com/cli/azure/cognitiveservices/account#az-cognitiveservices-account-list-usage) command to get the usage for your resource.

```azurecli-interactive
az cognitiveservices account list-usage --name foundry-multi-service-resource --resource-group ai-services-resource-group --subscription subscription-name
```

## Clean up resources

If you want to clean up and remove a Foundry resource, you can delete it or the resource group. Deleting the resource group also deletes any other resources contained in the group.

To remove the resource group and its associated resources, use the `az group delete command`.

```azurecli-interactive
az group delete --name ai-services-resource-group
```

Use this quickstart to create a Foundry resource using [Azure PowerShell](/powershell/azure/install-azure-powershell) commands. 

## Prerequisites

* A valid Azure subscription - [Create one](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/purchase-options/azure-account?cid=msft_learn) for free.
* [Azure PowerShell](/powershell/azure/install-azure-powershell) version 5.0 or later.
* Azure RBAC role to create resources. You need one of the following roles assigned on your Azure subscription or resource group:
  * Contributor
  * Owner
  * Custom role with `Microsoft.CognitiveServices/accounts/write` permission

## Install Azure PowerShell and sign in

Install [Azure PowerShell](/powershell/azure/install-azure-powershell). To sign in, run the [Connect-AzAccount](/powershell/module/az.accounts/connect-azaccount) command:

```azurepowershell
Connect-AzAccount
```

## Create a new Microsoft Foundry resource group

Before you create a Foundry resource, you must have an Azure resource group to contain the resource. When you create a new resource, you can either create a new resource group, or use an existing one. This article shows how to create a new resource group.

To create a resource, you'll need one of the Azure locations available for your subscription. You can retrieve a list of available locations with the [Get-AzLocation](/powershell/module/az.resources/get-azlocation) command. Most Foundry Tools can be accessed from several locations. Choose the one closest to you, or see which locations are available for the service.

<Warning>
* Remember your Azure location, as you will need it when calling the Foundry resources.
* The availability of some Foundry Tools can vary by region. For more information, see [Azure products by region](https://azure.microsoft.com/global-infrastructure/services/?products=cognitive-services).
</Warning>
```azurepowershell-interactive
Get-AzLocation | Select-Object -Property Location, DisplayName
```

After you have your Azure location, create a new resource group in Azure PowerShell using the [New-AzResourceGroup](/powershell/module/az.resources/new-azresourcegroup) command. In the example below, replace the Azure location `westus2` with one of the Azure locations available for your subscription.

```azurepowershell-interactive
New-AzResourceGroup -Name ai-services-resource-group -Location westus2
```

## Create a Foundry resource

To create and subscribe to a new Foundry resource, use the [New-AzCognitiveServicesAccount](/powershell/module/az.cognitiveservices/new-azcognitiveservicesaccount) command. This command adds a new billable resource to the resource group you created earlier. When you create your new resource, you'll need to know the "kind" of service you want to use, along with its pricing tier (or SKU) and an Azure location:

<Warning>
Azure provides more than one resource kinds for Foundry Tools. Be sure to create one with the `Type` (kind) of `AIServices`.
</Warning>
You can create a Foundry resource named `foundry-multi-service-resource` with the command below.

```azurepowershell-interactive
New-AzCognitiveServicesAccount -ResourceGroupName ai-services-resource-group -Name foundry-multi-service-resource -Type AIServices -SkuName S0 -Location westus2
```

<Tip>
If your subscription doesn't allow you to create a Foundry resource, you might need to enable the privilege of that [Azure resource provider](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/resource-providers-and-types#register-resource-provider) using the [Azure portal](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/resource-providers-and-types#azure-portal), [PowerShell command](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/resource-providers-and-types#azure-powershell) or an [Azure CLI command](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/resource-providers-and-types#azure-cli). If you are not the subscription owner, ask someone with the role of *Owner* or *Admin* to complete the registration for you or ask for the **/register/action** privileges to be granted to your account.
</Tip>
## Get current quota usage for your resource

Use the [Get-AzCognitiveServicesAccountUsage](/powershell/module/az.cognitiveservices/get-azcognitiveservicesaccountusage) command to get the usage for your resource.

```azurepowershell-interactive
Get-AzCognitiveServicesAccountUsage -ResourceGroupName ai-services-resource-group -Name foundry-multi-service-resource
```

## Clean up resources

If you want to clean up and remove a Foundry resource, you can delete it or the resource group. Deleting the resource group also deletes any other resources contained in the group.

To remove the resource group and its associated resources, use the [Remove-AzResourceGroup](/powershell/module/az.resources/remove-azresourcegroup) command.

```azurepowershell-interactive
Remove-AzResourceGroup -Name ai-services-resource-group
```

## Access your resource

With your first resource created, you can access it via [Foundry portal for UX prototyping](https://ai.azure.com/), [Foundry SDK for development](), or via [Azure portal for administrative management](https://portal.azure.com).

### Verify your setup

You can verify that your resource is set up correctly by using the Azure AI Projects SDK to connect and list projects. This minimal example confirms authentication and access.

```python
# Install the SDK: pip install azure-ai-projects azure-identity
from azure.ai.projects import AIProjectClient
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential

# Replace with your actual values from Azure portal
client = AIProjectClient(
    subscription_id="<your-subscription-id>",
    resource_group_name="<your-resource-group>",
    project_name="<your-project-name>",
    credential=DefaultAzureCredential()
)

# List projects to verify connection
projects = client.projects.list()
print(f"Successfully connected. Found {len(list(projects))} projects.")
```

**Expected output**: `Successfully connected. Found X projects.` where X is the number of projects in your resource.

**References**:
- [AIProjectClient class](https://learn.microsoft.com/python/api/azure-ai-projects/azure.ai.projects.aiprojectclient)
- [DefaultAzureCredential class](https://learn.microsoft.com/python/api/azure-identity/azure.identity.defaultazurecredential)

## Grant or obtain developer permissions

[Azure Role Based Access Control](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/resource-provider-operations) (RBAC) differentiates permissions between management and development actions. To build with Foundry, your user account must be assigned developer permissions ("data actions"). You can either use one of the built-in RBAC roles, or use a custom RBAC role.

Built-in Azure RBAC developer roles for Foundry include:

|Role|Description|
|---|---|
|Azure AI Project Manager|Grants development permissions, and project management permissions. Can invite other users to collaborate on a project as 'Azure AI User'.|
|Azure AI User|Grants development permissions.|
| **Azure AI Account Owner**   | Grants full access to manage AI projects and accounts. Can invite other users to collaborate on a project as 'Azure AI User'. |
| **Azure AI Owner**    | Grants full access to managed AI projects and accounts and build and develop with projects. |

<Note>
The Azure AI Owner role will be available to assign in the Azure and Foundry portal soon.
</Note>
![Diagram of the built-in roles in Foundry.](/images/detailed-rbac-diagram.png)

For larger enterprises with strict role based access requirements, we recommend utilizing the Azure AI User role the least  privilege developer permissions. For smaller enterprises wanting their developers to self-serve within their organization, we recommend utilizing the Azure AI Owner role for developer permissions as well as resource creation permissions. 

Only authorized users, typically the Azure subscription or resource group owner, can assign a role via either [Azure portal](link to Azure portal) or [Foundry portal via Admin](Link to Foundry portal). [Learn more about role-based access control](/security/rbac-foundry).

<Warning>
Azure Owner and Contributor roles do only include management permissions, and not development permissions. Development permissions are required to build with all capabilities in Foundry.
</Warning>
## Start building in your first project

With permissions set up, you're now ready to start building Foundry. In [Foundry portal](https://ai.azure.com/) open or [create your first project](/setup/create-projects). Projects organize your agent and model customization work in Foundry, and you can [create multiple under the same resource](/setup/create-projects#create-multiple-projects-on-the-same-resource).
