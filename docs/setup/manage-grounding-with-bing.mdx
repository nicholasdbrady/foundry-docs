# Manage Grounding With Bing in Microsoft Foundry and Azure

Grounding with Bing enables agents to retrieve and incorporate real-time public web data into model-generated responses. It supports summarization, question answering, conversational assistance, and other scenarios by using Grounding with Bing Search or Grounding with Bing Custom Search to fill knowledge gaps.

Grounding is available across features in Foundry Agent Service and Azure AI Search. You might need to disable access to these features to meet compliance, privacy, or data governance requirements.

As an admin, you can manage access to Grounding with Bing in the following ways:

+ [Disable Grounding with Bing Search tools](#disable-grounding-with-bing-search-tools) in Foundry Agent Service.
+ [Disable web search tool](#disable-web-search-tool) in Foundry Agent Service.
+ [Disable web knowledge](#disable-web-knowledge) in Azure AI Search.
