# Rate limits, region, and virtual network support for evaluation

<Note>

This article provides an overview of which regions support AI-assisted evaluators, the rate limits that apply to evaluation runs, and how to configure virtual network support for network isolation.

## Region support

### Risk and safety evaluators and AI red teaming region support

Certain AI-assisted evaluators and AI red teaming are available only in the following regions:

| Region | Hate and unfairness, Sexual, Violent, Self-harm, Indirect attack, Code vulnerabilities, Ungrounded attributes,  AI red teaming | Groundedness Pro | Protected material |
|--|--|--|--|
| East US 2 | Supported | Supported | Supported |
| Sweden Central | Supported | Supported | N/A |
| US North Central | Supported | N/A | N/A |
| France Central | Supported | N/A | N/A |
| Switzerland West | Supported | N/A | N/A |

### Agent playground evaluation region support

Supported regions for agent playground evaluation in the Foundry portal:

- East US 2
- West US
- West US 2
- West US 3
- France Central
- Norway East
- Sweden Central

### Unsupported regions for batch evaluation

Batch evaluations aren't supported in the following regions:

- Canada Central
- Qatar Central
- South Central US
- Southeast Asia
- Spain Central

### Unsupported regions for Azure OpenAI graders

The following regions don't support Azure OpenAI graders or custom code evaluator:

- Canada East
- Central India
- East Asia
- East US
- North Europe
- South India

## Rate limits

The following rate limits apply to evaluation runs:

| Limit | Value |
|--|--|
| Maximum size per row | 2 MB |
| Maximum rows per batch evaluation | 100,000 |

Evaluation run creations are rate-limited at the tenant, subscription, and project levels. If you exceed the limit:

- The response includes a `retry-after` header with the wait time.
- The response body contains rate limit details.

Use exponential backoff when retrying failed requests.

## Virtual network support for evaluation

For network isolation purposes, you can bring your own virtual network for evaluation. To learn more, see [How to configure a private link](/security/configure-private-link).

<Note>
If you connect Application Insights, evaluation data is sent to it. Virtual network support for Application Insights and tracing isn't available. Inline datasource isn't supported.
</Note>
<Info>
To prevent evaluation and red teaming run failures, assign the Azure AI User role to the project's Managed Identity during initial project setup.

### Virtual network region support

Bring your own virtual network for evaluation is supported in all regions except:

- Central India
- East Asia
- North Europe
- Qatar Central
