# Use a screen reader with Microsoft Foundry

<Note>
This article refers to the [Microsoft Foundry (new)](/overview/what-is-foundry#microsoft-foundry-portals) portal.
</Note>{/* > 🔄 [Switch to the Microsoft Foundry (classic) documentation]() if you're using the classic portal. */}

This article is for people who use screen readers such as [Microsoft's Narrator](https://support.microsoft.com/windows/complete-guide-to-narrator-e4397a0d-ef4f-b386-d8ae-c172f109bdb1#WindowsVersion=Windows_11), JAWS, NVDA, or Apple's VoiceOver. In this quickstart, you learn about the basic structure of Microsoft Foundry and how to navigate around efficiently. 

## Get oriented in Foundry portal 

Most [Microsoft Foundry](https://ai.azure.com/?cid=learnDocs) (new) pages have the following landmark structure: 

- Banner has 
    - Foundry application title
    - Project selector
    - Search
    - Ask AI toggle
    - Main section navigation: Home, Discover, Build, Operate, Docs
    - Settings
    - Profile information
- Left pane has navigation for the section selected in the main navigation. The Home page has no left pane navigation. 
- Many pages also have tabs as a third level of navigation.

For efficient navigation, you can use landmarks to move between these sections on the page.

## Switch between portal experiences

You can switch between the classic and new Foundry portal experiences using the **New Foundry** toggle in the top banner.

To switch back to the classic experience:
1. In the top banner, press <kbd>Tab</kbd> until you hear "New Foundry toggle button, pressed".
1. Select the toggle to switch to the classic experience.
1. The page reloads with the classic portal interface.

<Note>
The toggle preserves your current context, such as the project you're working in, when switching between experiences.

## Projects 

You enter the portal with a selected project. The navigation sections **Home**, **Discover**, and **Build** display content for your selected project. The **Operate** section is different - it shows information for all your projects.

To create or switch projects:
1. In [Microsoft Foundry](https://ai.azure.com/?cid=learnDocs), on the top banner, select **Foundry**.
1. Press <kbd>Tab</kbd> until you hear a project name.
1. Use the down-arrow to scroll through the list of recent projects.
1. At the end of the list of recent projects, you find options to **View all projects**, **Create new project**, and **View legacy resources**.
