# Azure Marketplace requirements for Foundry Models from partners
Certain Microsoft Foundry Models are offered directly by the model provider through the Azure Marketplace. These models belong to the collection of [Foundry Models from partners and community](/models/catalog/models-from-partners). This article explains the requirements to use Azure Marketplace if you plan to use such models in your workloads. [Foundry Models sold directly by Azure](/models/catalog/models-sold-directly-by-azure), like DeepSeek, Black Forest Labs, or Azure OpenAI in Foundry Models, don't have this requirement.

## Prerequisites

- An Azure subscription. If you don't have one, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).

<Info>
The following Azure subscriptions can't be used to purchase software as a service (SaaS) offers in Marketplace: Student, Visual Studio Enterprise, or Free credit. For more information on purchasing SaaS offers, see [The SaaS purchase experience](/marketplace/purchase-saas-offer-in-azure-portal#the-saas-purchase-experience).
</Info>

- A [Microsoft Foundry project](/setup/create-projects).

## Permissions required to subscribe to Models from Partners and Community

[Foundry Models from partners and community](../../concepts/models-from-partners.md) available for deployment (for example, Cohere models) require Azure Marketplace. Model providers define the license terms and set the price for use of their models using Azure Marketplace.

When deploying third-party models, ensure you have the following permissions in your account:

<Check>On the Azure subscription:</Check>
<Check>`Microsoft.MarketplaceOrdering/agreements/offers/plans/read`</Check>
<Check>`Microsoft.MarketplaceOrdering/agreements/offers/plans/sign/action`</Check>
<Check>`Microsoft.MarketplaceOrdering/offerTypes/publishers/offers/plans/agreements/read`</Check>
<Check>`Microsoft.Marketplace/offerTypes/publishers/offers/plans/agreements/read`</Check>
<Check>`Microsoft.SaaS/register/action`</Check>
<Check>On the resource group—to create and use the SaaS resource:</Check>
<Check>`Microsoft.SaaS/resources/read`</Check>
<Check>`Microsoft.SaaS/resources/write`</Check>
The **Owner** and **Contributor** built-in roles on the Azure subscription include these permissions. If you don't have the required permissions, ask your subscription administrator to assign you the **Contributor** role, or [create a custom role](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/custom-roles) that includes the listed actions.

To verify your permissions, go to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), open your subscription, select **Access control (IAM)** > **Check access**, and review your assigned roles.

<Tip>
`Microsoft.SaaS/register/action` is a one-time registration of the SaaS resource provider on the subscription. After registration, it doesn't need to be repeated for each deployment.
</Tip>

## Country/region availability

Users can access models from partners and community with pay-as-you-go billing only if their Azure subscription belongs to a billing account in a country/region or region where the model offer is available. Availability varies per model provider and model SKU. For more information, see [Region availability for models](../../../foundry-classic/how-to/deploy-models-serverless-availability.md).

## Troubleshooting

Use the following troubleshooting guide to find and solve errors when deploying third-party models in Foundry Models:

| Error | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Offer not available in your country/region | The model provider didn't make the specific model SKU available in the country/region where you registered your subscription. Each model provider decides which countries/regions are available, and availability can vary by model SKU. Deploy the model to a subscription with billing in a supported country/region. See [Region availability for models](../../../foundry-classic/how-to/deploy-models-serverless-availability.md). |
| Marketplace purchase eligibility check failed | The model provider didn't make the specific model SKU available in your country/region, or the model isn't available in the region where you deployed the Foundry resource. See [Region availability for models](../../../foundry-classic/how-to/deploy-models-serverless-availability.md). |
| Unable to create a model deployment | Azure Marketplace rejected the request to create a model subscription. This rejection can happen for multiple reasons, including subscribing to the model offering too often or from multiple subscriptions at the same time. Contact [support](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2101400&clcid=0x409) and include your subscription ID. |
| CSP subscription not supported | Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) subscriptions can't purchase third-party model offerings. Consider using models offered as a first-party consumption service. |
