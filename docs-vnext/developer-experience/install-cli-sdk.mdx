# Prepare your development environment
Set up your development environment to use the Microsoft Foundry SDK. You also need Azure CLI for authentication so that your code can access your user credentials.

In this article, you install language runtimes, Azure CLI, Azure Developer CLI, the Foundry VS Code extension, and Git.

<Info>
This article covers **general prerequisites** only, such as language runtimes, global tools, and VS Code and extension setup.  
It doesn't cover scenario-specific steps like SDK installation or authentication.  
When your environment is ready, continue to the [quickstart](/get-started/quickstart-create-foundry-resources) for those instructions.
</Info>
## Prerequisites

- An Azure account with an active subscription. If you don't have one, create a [free Azure account, which includes a free trial subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/purchase-options/azure-account?cid=msft_learn).
- Download, install, and configure Visual Studio Code, or the IDE of your choice. For more information, see [Download Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download).
- To create and manage Foundry resources, one of the following Azure RBAC roles 
  - **Azure AI Project Manager** (for managing Foundry projects)
  - **Owner** (for subscription-level permissions). Owner is necessary for additional role assignments required for other scenarios in Foundry. To ensure you are unblocked for all scenarios in Foundry, Owner is the role assignment required.
- To use project but not create new resources, you need at least:
  - **Azure AI User** on the projects you use (least-privilege role for development)

  For details on each role's permissions, see [Role-based access control for Microsoft Foundry](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-foundry/concepts/rbac-foundry).

## Install your programming language

In Visual Studio Code, create a new folder for your project. Open a terminal window in that folder.

First, create a new Python environment. Don't install packages into your global Python installation. Always use a virtual or conda environment when installing Python packages. Otherwise, you can break your global install of Python.

### If needed, install Python

Use Python 3.10 or later, but at least Python 3.9 is required. If you don't have a suitable version of Python installed, follow the instructions in the [VS Code Python Tutorial](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/python-tutorial#_install-a-python-interpreter) for the easiest way of installing Python on your operating system.

### Create a virtual environment

If you already have Python 3.10 or higher installed, create a virtual environment by using the following commands:

<CodeGroup>
```bash Windows
    py -3 -m venv .venv
    .venv\scripts\activate
    ```

```bash Linux
    python3 -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```

```bash macOS
    python3 -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```
</CodeGroup>

When you activate the Python environment, running `python` or `pip` from the command line uses the Python interpreter in the `.venv` folder of your application.

<Note>
Use the `deactivate` command to exit the Python virtual environment. You can reactivate it later when needed.
</Note>

### Install the Python extension for Visual Studio Code

The Python extension for Visual Studio Code supports Python with IntelliSense, debugging, formatting, linting, code navigation, refactoring, variable explorer, test explorer, and environment management.

[Install the Python Extension for Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python).

Install:

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 17 or later
    - We recommend the [Microsoft Build of OpenJDK](https://learn.microsoft.com/java/openjdk/download), which is a free, Long-Term Support (LTS) distribution of OpenJDK

### Install the Visual Studio Code Extension Pack for Java

The Extension Pack for Java is a collection of popular extensions that can help you write, test, and debug Java applications in Visual Studio Code. 

[Install the Visual Studio Code Extension Pack for Java](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscjava.vscode-java-pack).

Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 18 or later is recommended).

Ensure you have the necessary tools installed for .NET development.

### Install the .NET SDK

You need the .NET SDK (Software Development Kit) to create, build, and run .NET applications. We recommend installing the latest LTS (Long Term Support) version or a later version if required by your project.

1. Download the .NET SDK from the [official .NET download page](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download). Select the appropriate installer for your operating system (Windows, Linux, or macOS).
1. Follow the installation instructions for your operating system.
1. Verify the installation by opening a terminal or command prompt and running:

    ```bash
    dotnet --version
    ```

    The response should be the installed SDK version.

### Install the C# Dev Kit for Visual Studio Code

For the best C# development experience in VS Code, install the official C# Dev Kit extension:

1. Open Visual Studio Code.
1. Go to the Extensions view (Ctrl+Shift+X or Cmd+Shift+X).
1. Search for **C# Dev Kit**.
1. Install the extension published by Microsoft. This will also install the base C# extension if you don't already have it.

### Create a new .NET Project

You can create a new .NET project using the terminal integrated into Visual Studio Code (Terminal > New Terminal).

For example, to create a new console application:

```bash
# Navigate to the directory where you want to create your project
# cd path/to/your/projects

# Create a new console application in a subfolder named MyConsoleApp
dotnet new console -o MyConsoleApp

# Navigate into the newly created project folder
cd MyConsoleApp
```

You can now open this `MyConsoleApp` folder in VS Code (File > Open Folder...) to start working on your C# project. VS Code, with the C# Dev Kit extension, will automatically detect the project, enabling features like IntelliSense, debugging, and build tasks.

##  Install the Azure CLI and sign in 

You install the [Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/cli/azure/what-is-azure-cli) and sign in from your local development environment, so that you can use your user credentials to call Azure OpenAI in Microsoft Foundry Models.

In most cases you can install Azure CLI from your terminal using the following command: 

<CodeGroup>
```powershell Windows
    winget install -e --id Microsoft.AzureCLI
    ```

```bash Linux
    curl -sL https://aka.ms/InstallAzureCLIDeb | sudo bash
    ```

```bash macOS
    brew update && brew install azure-cli
    ```
</CodeGroup>

You can follow instructions [How to install the Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) if these commands don't work for your particular operating system or setup.

After you install the Azure CLI, sign in using the ``az login`` command and sign-in using the browser:

```
az login
```

Alternatively, you can sign in manually via the browser with a device code.

```
az login --use-device-code
```

Keep this terminal open to run scripts after signing in.

## Install the Azure Developer CLI

The Azure Developer CLI (azd) is an open-source tool that helps you set up and deploy app resources on Azure. It provides simple commands for key stages of development, whether you use a terminal, IDE, or CI/CD pipelines.
[Install the Azure Developer CLI for your platform](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/install-azd).

Many of the [AI solution templates](/developer-experience/ai-template-get-started) include a deployment option using `azd`.

## Install the Foundry VS Code extension

The Foundry extension for Visual Studio Code lets you deploy models, build AI apps, and work with Agents directly from the VS Code interface. [Install the Foundry VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TeamsDevApp.vscode-ai-foundry).

## Install Git

Git is required to clone Foundry SDK samples. If you don't have Git installed, [follow the instructions for your platform](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and select your operating system.

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Resolution |
| ----- | ---------- |
| Command not found after install | Close and reopen your terminal, or restart VS Code, so PATH changes take effect. |
| `az login` fails with a browser error | Run `az login --use-device-code` to authenticate using a device code flow instead. |
| Python not found | Use `python3` instead of `python` on macOS/Linux, or install a supported version (3.9 or later). |
| Permission denied during install | On macOS/Linux, avoid `sudo pip install`. Use a [virtual environment](#create-a-virtual-environment) instead. |
